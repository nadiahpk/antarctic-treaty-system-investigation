Recommendation I-IV (ATCM I - Canberra, 1961)

The Representatives agree, without prejudice to the rights of Governments to make such arrangements as they may deem necessary to further the objectives of scientific co-operation set forth in the Treaty:

(1) that the free exchange of information and views among scientists participating in SCAR, and the recommendations concerning scientific programmes and co-operation formulated by this body constitute a most valuable contribution to international scientific co-operation in Antarctica;

(2) that since these activities of SCAR constitute the kind of activity contemplated in Article III of the Treaty, SCAR should be encouraged to continue this advisory work which has so effectively facilitated international co-operation in scientific investigation.
