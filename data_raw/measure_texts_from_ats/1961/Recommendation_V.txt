Recommendation I-V (ATCM I - Canberra, 1961)

The Representatives recommend to their Governments that they should individually encourage the work of international organisations having a scientific or technical interest in Antarctica, including the specialised agencies of the United Nations, and should promote on a bilateral basis the establishment and development of co-operative working relations with these organisations.  

In this connection, the Representatives take note of the letter to the Minister of State for External Affairs of Australia from the Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organisation dated 28th June 1961, circulated at the Meeting.  They welcome the offer made by the World Meteorological Organisation of co-operation in questions of meteorology and of the collection and relaying of meteorological data in the Antarctic, and recommend to their Governments that they should establish co-operation in these matters through their Representatives in that Organisation.
