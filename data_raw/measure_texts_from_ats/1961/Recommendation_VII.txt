Recommendation I-VII (ATCM I - Canberra, 1961)

The Representatives recommend to their Governments that they should undertake to exchange information on logistic problems.  This might include information on the design and construction of buildings and airstrips, the provision of power supplies, the performance of aircraft, ships, tractors and other vehicles, techniques of supply of coastal and inland stations, the transport and handling of cargo in Antarctic conditions, food and cold weather clothing.  
They further recommend that consideration should be given to the calling of a meeting or symposium of experts to consider the question of the exchange of information on experience gained in matters of the organisation of expeditions, logistic support and transport, and that proposals for the calling of such a meeting or symposium should be discussed at or before the next Treaty Consultative Meeting.
