Recommendation V-5 (ATCM V - Paris, 1968)

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS:
FILDES PENINSULA

The Representatives, considering that Fildes Peninsula has several small lakes which, being ice-free in summer, are of outstanding ecological interest and that the most interesting one of them should be specially protected, recommend to their Governments that, in place of the description in Recommendation IV-12, the following be inserted in Annex B, Specially Protected Areas, of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora:

"SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREA No. 12, Fildes Peninsula, 
King George Island/25 May, South Shetland Islands,
Lat. 62°11'S., long. 58°52'W.

Description:  The fresh-water lake, including the surrounding land within 100 metres of the shore, situated about 500 metres north of Suffield Point and 2.5 kilometres east-north-east of Bellinghausen Station on Fildes Peninsula.  The area is shown on the attached map."
