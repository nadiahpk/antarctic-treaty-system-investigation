Recommendation V-7 (ATCM V - Paris, 1968)

CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS OF SCAR FOR THE REVISION OF THE INTERIM GUIDE LINES FOR THE VOLUNTARY REGULATION OF ANTARCTIC PELAGIC SEALING

Taking into account the importance of conserving seals south of 60ยบ South Latitude; 

Considering that in the future an international Convention for the regulation of Antarctic pelagic sealing may be required; 

The Representatives recommend to their governments that, when implementing Recommendation IV-21, and until a decision is taken on the conclusion of an international Convention, they should voluntarily take account of the proposals of SCAR in its report to National Antarctic Committees in 1968 on the modification of the "Interim Guide Lines for the Voluntary Regulation of Antarctic Pelagic Sealing", as appended in a revised form to the Report of the Fifth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.
