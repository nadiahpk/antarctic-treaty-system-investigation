Recommendation X-4 (ATCM X - Washington, 1979)

MAN'S IMPACT ON THE ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT: COLLECTION OF GEOLOGICAL SPECIMENS

The Representatives,

Recalling Article II of the Antarctic Treaty;

Recognising that an essential element in geological investigations is the collection and removal of specimens but that the removal of specimens from areas which are of exceptional geological interest needs, as far as is practicable, to be kept to a minimum in order to avoid prejudicing subsequent geological investigations in such areas:

Noting that:

 (i)   this problem is presented in a more acute form in areas where more than one expedition is undertaking geological investigations;

 (ii)  a similar problem has already been recognised with regard to the collection of meteorites;

 (iii) it might be appropriate to designate small areas which are of exceptional geological interest as Sites of Special Scientific Interest;

Recommend to their Governments that, through their National Committees, they refer the matter to the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) for further study.
