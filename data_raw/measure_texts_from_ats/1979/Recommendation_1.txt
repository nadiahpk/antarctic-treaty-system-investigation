Recommendation X-1 (ATCM X - Washington, 1979)

ANTARCTIC MINERAL RESOURCES

The Representatives, 

Convinced of the need to preserve and further strengthen the international regime established in Antarctica by the Antarctic Treaty, which has for nearly two decades guaranteed the use of Antarctica exclusively for peaceful purposes, and in the interest of the development of international cooperation; 

Aware of the responsibilities of the Consultative Parties to ensure that any activities in Antarctica, including mineral exploration and exploitation, should they occur, should be consistent with all the principles and purposes of the Antarctic Treaty system, including its objectives that activities in Antarctica should not become the cause of international discord, endanger the unique Antarctic environment, or disrupt scientific investigations; 

Concerned that unregulated mineral resource activities could significantly harm the fragile Antarctic ecosystem; 

Noting that decisions on possible mineral resource activities must take due account of the unique ecological and scientific value of Antarctica and the importance of Antarctica to the world environment; 

Recognizing that available information is insufficient reliably to assess the possible environmental effects of many activities in the area of exploration and exploitation of mineral resources in Antarctica, and conscious of the need for developing research programs aimed at improving predictions of the possible impact of such activities in Antarctica and for promoting the development of monitoring programs aimed at detecting the impact of such activities on the Antarctic environment should such activities occur; 

Convinced that informed decision-making on questions of mineral resource activities will usually require the availability of information from such programs; 

Aware also of the necessity to obtain additional scientific information with a view to facilitating the development of measures related to the protection of the Antarctic environment from possible harmful impacts of mineral resource exploration and exploitation, should such activities occur; 

Noting that a meeting of ecological, technological, and other related experts was held in Washington, D.C., 25 June to 29 June, 1979, as part of the Preparatory Meeting to the Tenth Consultative Meeting with a view to developing scientific programs aimed at improving predictions of the impact of possible technologies for mineral exploration and exploitation in the Antarctic, and developing measures for the prevention of damage to the environment or for its rehabilitation; 

Recalling the provisions of Recommendations VIII-14 and IX-1; 

Recognizing the necessity for progress towards the timely adoption of an agreed regime concerning Antarctic mineral resources; 

Recommend to their Governments that: 

1.  They take note of the progress made toward the timely adoption of a regime for Antarctic mineral resources at the Tenth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting and related meetings, and of the importance of this progress. 

2.  They continue consultations proceeding from the provisions of Recommendation IX-1 and from the provisions of the present Recommendation. 
To this end, they should: 

     (i) Continue to develop a common understanding of the general purposes of the regime and to identify the specific elements of the regime needed to ensure achievement of those purposes; 

     (ii)  Continue to give thorough examination to all of the elements necessary to ensure that the future regime will achieve its general purposes;  

     (iii)  Hold a meeting before the Eleventh Consultative Meeting, preferably in the first half of 1980, to consider a regime for Antarctic mineral resources in its ecological, political, technological, legal and other aspects; and 

    (iv)  in this regard, make the best possible use of the report of the Tenth Consultative Working Group on Antarctic Resources -- The Question of Mineral Exploration and Exploitation: Legal and Political Aspects (which is annexed to the Final Report of the Tenth Consultative Meeting) and of the section of this Final Report which refers to the work of the Working Group on Antarctic Resources -- The Question of Mineral Exploration and Exploitation: Scientific and Environmental Aspects. 

3.  The agreed regime for Antarctic mineral resources should be based upon provisions of paragraphs 1, 3, 4, and 5 of Recommendation IX-1 and on such further principles, rules and arrangements as may be subsequently agreed. 

4.  An agreed regime on Antarctic mineral resources should include inter alia means for: 

    (i)  assessing the possible impact of mineral resource activities on the Antarctic environment in order to provide for informed decision-making; 

    (ii)  determining whether mineral resource activities will be acceptable; 

   (iii)  governing the ecological, technological, political, legal, and economic aspects of those activities in cases where they would be determined acceptable; including: 

        a) establishing, as an important part of the regime, rules relating to the protection of the Antarctic environment; and 

        b) requiring that mineral resource activities undertaken pursuant to the regime be undertaken in compliance with such rules. 

5.  Taking account of the Report of Ecological, Technological, and Other Related Experts on Mineral Exploration and Exploitation in Antarctica (Washington, June 1979), attached as an annex to the Report of the Tenth Consultative Meeting, they facilitate their research activities which would contribute to an improved understanding of relevant aspects of the Antarctic and its environment. 

6.  With a view to improving predictions of the environmental impacts of activities, events, and technologies associated with mineral resource exploration and exploitation in the Antarctic should such occur, they, through their respective National Antarctic Committees, encourage the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research to define programs, taking account of the Experts Report (Washington, June 1979), with the objectives of: 

     a.  retrieving and analyzing relevant information from past observations and research programs; 

     b.  ensuring in relation to the needs for information identified by the Experts Report, that effective use is made of existing programs; 

     c.  identifying and developing new programs that should have priority, taking account of the length of time required for results to become available. 

7.  In so far as is feasible they support, as appropriate, their respective National Antarctic Committees and the offices administering their Antarctic research programs in developments arising from the previous paragraph. 

8.  The subject "Antarctic Resources - The Question of Mineral Exploration and Exploitation" be placed in the Agenda of the Eleventh Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.
