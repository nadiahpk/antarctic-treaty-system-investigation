Recommendation X-8 (ATCM X - Washington, 1979)

EFFECTS OF TOURISTS AND NON-GOVERNMENT EXPEDITIONS IN THE ANTARCTIC TREATY AREA

The Representatives, 

Recalling that Annex A to Recommendation VIII-9 was to be discussed at the Ninth Consultative Meeting and that a draft text of a Statement of Accepted Practices and the Relevant Provisions of the Antarctic Treaty was referred from the Ninth to the Tenth Consultative Meeting; 

 Recognizing that, in addition to the statement referred to in the previous paragraph which is primarily intended for the organizers of tourist expeditions, it would be helpful to the organizers of such expeditions to be able to provide to individual visitors a brief guide to good conduct in the Antarctic; 

Noting that adventurous individuals organizing non-governmental expeditions to Antarctica may seek help or advice from offices administering Antarctic programs; 

Recognizing, also, that in considering responses to requests for help from such expeditions, an important concern is the possibility that such expeditions may, in cases of emergency, involve the offices administering Antarctic programs in financial or material loss; 

Recognizing that suitably qualified guides accompanying commercially organized Antarctic tours would both benefit the tourists and help to ensure that the conservation and environmental measures adopted by the Consultative Parties were observed; 

Reaffirming the traditional principle in the Antarctic of rendering all assistance feasible in the event of an emergency request for help, but noting that commercial overflights of Antarctica are operating in a particularly hazardous environment, where aircraft operation systems normally available elsewhere in the world are at a minimum, and where emergencies could arise which are beyond the capacity of permanent Antarctic expeditions to respond adequately; 

Recommend to their Governments that: 

                                                   I. Statement of accepted Practices and the Relevant Provisions of the Antarctic Treaty 
They insert the attached statement of Accepted Practices and the Relevant Provisions of the Antarctic Treaty into Annex A to Recommendation VIII-9 for the purposes set out in operative paragraph 1 of that Recommendation. 

                                                                                             II. Non-Governmental Expeditions
If a non-governmental expedition approaches a Consultative Party for help or advice, that Consultative Party should inform the Contracting Party where the expedition to Antarctica is being organized and may request all relevant information about the expedition.
They urge non-governmental expeditions to carry adequate insurance cover against the risk of their incurring financial charges or material losses in the Antarctic Treaty Area. 

                                                                                                           III. Tour Guides 
To the extent practicable, they encourage commercial tour operators to carry tour guides with experience of Antarctic conditions, who are aware of the considerations which underlie the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora and for the protection of the Antarctic environment. 

                                                                                           IV. Commercial Overflights in Antarctica  
They notify commercial aircraft operators that the present level of tourist overflight activity: 

    (i) exceeds existing capabilities for air traffic control, communications and search and rescue in the Antarctic; 

   (ii) may interfere with normal operational flights in support of expeditions engaged in ongoing scientific programs in the Antarctic; 

   (iii) exceeds the capacity of their Antarctic operations to respond adequately to an unplanned emergency landing.
