Recommendation X-7 (ATCM X - Washington, 1979)

OIL CONTAMINATION OF THE ANTARCTIC MARINE ENVIRONMENT

The Representatives, 

Recalling that paragraph 4 of Recommendation IX-6 called for such reports as might have been prepared on the matters set out in the first three paragraphs of that Recommendation to be considered at the Meeting of Experts recommended in paragraph 3 of Recommendation IX-1; 

Noting that three reports were submitted to that meeting (Washington, June 1979) which, between them: 

   (i) outlined the probable pathways by which oil might reach the Antarctic marine environment; 

  (ii) concentrated on the question of baseline measurements of the hydrocarbon content of the Antarctic marine environment and on programs for further study  of this question; 

  (iii) devoted less attention to proposals relating to practicable means by which oil contamination of the Antarctic marine environment might be reduced; 

  (iv) noted the need for further studies relating to the problem of oil contamination of the Antarctic marine environment; 

Recognizing that methods for analysing dissolved hydrocarbons have not yet reached the stage where they can be used on a routine basis and that the results of such measurements have given rise to differing interpretations as to their environmental significance, especially regarding very low levels of hydrocarbon content in water samples from the open ocean;

Recognizing that determination of baseline measurements of the hydrocarbon content in representative components of the Antarctic marine ecosystem (including birds and mammals) would probably, in the medium term, provide a more cost-effective insight into levels of oil contamination of the Antarctic marine environment; 

Noting that up to now the most significant introduction of oil in the Antarctic marine environment has appeared to be from the operation of ships and that there are international agreements aimed at reducing the levels of oil contamination of the marine environment generally; 

Recognizing that the presence of ice in Antarctic waters gives rise to particular hazards for the operation of ships; and 

Noting that in many instances it may not be feasible to adapt existing ships to more stringent standards for the prevention of the contamination of the sea by oil than those which existed at the time these ships were built; 

Recommend to their Governments that: 

1. They take note of Section III of the Report of Ecological, Technological, and other Related Experts on Mineral Exploration and Exploitation in Antarctica (Washington, 1979), annexed to the Final Report of the Tenth Consultative Meeting; 

                                                                                        I.  Baseline Levels of Hydrocarbon Content 
2.  While coordinating programs through their National Committees and the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), they encourage studies of:   

    (a) baseline measurements of hydrocarbon content in representative components of the Antarctic marine ecosystem (including birds and mammals); 

    (b) the effects of various kinds and concentrations of hydrocarbons (and other pollutants) on key components of the Antarctic marine ecosystem; 

    (c) the methodology of analysing low levels of dissolved hydrocarbon content of the marine environment and the development of this methodology for purposes of routine measurements; 

3.  Through their National Committees, they invite SCAR in consultation with other appropriate international organizations, to keep under review the possibility of developing a program for the determination of baseline measurements of hydrocarbon content relevant to the needs for such determinations in the Antarctic marine environment. 

                                                                                       II. Reduction of the Risk of Contamination 
4. They review their respective obligations under existing international agreements to which they are parties which relate to the reduction of contamination of the sea by oil and, in the light of the particularly hazardous nature of the Antarctic for ship operations, consider whether their compliance with these obligations adequately minimizes the risk of oil contamination of the Antarctic marine environment; 

5. They be prepared to discuss this matter further at the Eleventh Consultative Meeting.
