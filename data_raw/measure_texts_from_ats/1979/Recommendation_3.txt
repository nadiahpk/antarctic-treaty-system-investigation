Recommendation X-3 (ATCM X - Washington, 1979)

IMPROVEMENT OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS IN ANTARCTICA AND THE COLLECTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF ANTARCTIC METEOROLOGICAL DATA

The Representatives, 

Recalling Recommendations VI-1, VI-3, and VII-7; 

Noting that the Third Antarctic Treaty Meeting on Telecommunications held in Washington in September 1978 had described the telecommunications network for the exchange of meteorological data both within the Antarctic and between the Antarctic and Global Telecommunications System (GTS) of the World Weather Watch (WWW) as it existed on September 1978 (see Annexes 1, 2 and 3).

Taking account of the importance of Antarctic meteorological data to the WWW and the diminished value of such data if it is not available to users within and outside the Antarctic in accordance with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) schedules for the receipt of raw and processed data; 

Reaffirming the importance of the GTS for purposes of transmitting Antarctic meteorological data between Antarctic stations in cases where direct transmission within Antarctica is inhibited by ionospheric conditions; 

Noting, with appreciation, the response of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) to Recommendation IX-3 and the improvement in Antarctic telecommunications that would follow if operators and offices administering Antarctic programs had available to them statements of the current telecommunications practices within and between national networks; 

Recognizing that changing national requirements for Antarctic telecommunications, changing technology or budgetary constraints may lead to significant incompatibilities arising between national networks; 

Recognizing that possible future trans-polar commercial air traffic and the steadily increasing amount of shipping in the Antarctic region may give rise to a changing pattern of needs for raw and processed meteorological data; 

Affirming that developments in the collection and distribution of meteorological data should be reviewed from time to time; 

Recommend to their Governments that: 

1.  Taking account of the final report of the Third Antarctic Treaty Meeting on Telecommunications, they should strive to improve the system for the collection and distribution of Antarctic meteorological data having regard particularly to increasing efficiency, reliability and economy of effort; taking into account opportunities offered by new technology;

2.  Each station undertaking meteorological observations should ensure that data are transmitted as soon as practicable after the observation; 

3.  Stations receiving these data for onward transmission to other Antarctic stations or to the GTS should forward such data with minimum delay; 

4.  In cooperation with other Antarctic stations and World Meteorological Centers, they continue regularly to monitor receipt of Antarctic data by, and its transmission within, the GTS; 

5.  In cooperation with the WWW, they seek to ensure that the transmission of these data from the GTS to Antarctic stations is facilitated in cases where this method is likely to be more reliable or cost-effective than trans-Antarctic transmissions; 

6.  Through their National Antarctic Committees, they invite SCAR to prepare a brief handbook of the telecommunications practices within and between national networks in a format which allows it to be amended periodically in the light of changes in national practices; 

7.  For the purposes of the previous paragraph, they ensure that their offices administering Antarctic programs inform SCAR in June and December each year of changes in their telecommunications practices; 

8.  Subject to overriding scientific, administrative or budgetary reasons, they seek to ensure, by means of appropriate contacts with the offices administering Antarctic programs, that transmission of meteorological data between Antarctic stations is not prejudiced by changes in their telecommunications practices; 

9.  They invite WMO, through their Permanent Representatives to that Organization, to review Annexes 1 and 2 of Recommendation VI-3 with a view to advising Consultative Parties about current, and probable future, requirements for both raw and processed data in the Antarctic region; 

10.  Not later than at the Twelfth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting they review developments in Antarctic telecommunications for meteorological purposes, having sought in the interim period to resolve any international difficulties that may arise with regard to the system by appropriate discussion.
