The Representatives,

Recalling the requirements of Article 8 of Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty to maintain a list of current Historic Sites and Monuments, and that such sites shall not be damaged, removed or destroyed;
Recalling Measure 3 (2003), which revised and updated the “List of Historic Sites and Monuments”, as subsequently amended;
Desiring to add two further historic sites to the List of Historic Sites and Monuments;
  
Recommend to their Governments the following Measure for approval in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 8 of Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty;
That the following sites be added to the “List of Historic Sites and Monuments” annexed to Measure 3 (2003):

No 83: Base “W”, Detaille Island, Lallemand Fjord, Loubet Coast
Base “W” is situated on a narrow isthmus at the northern end of Detaille Island, Lallemand Fjord, Loubet Coast.    The site consists of a hut and a range of associated structures and outbuildings including a small emergency storage building, bitch and pup pens, anemometer tower and two standard tubular steel radio masts (one to the south west of the main hut and the other to the east).  
Base “W” was established in 1956 as a British science base primarily for survey, geology and meteorology and to contribute to the IGY in 1957. As a relatively unaltered base from the late 1950s, Base “W” provides an important reminder of the science and living conditions that existed when the Antarctic Treaty was signed 50 years ago.
