Recommendation IX-3 (ATCM IX - London, 1977)

IMPROVEMENT OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS IN THE ANTARCTIC

The Representatives, 

Considering that requirements in the field of telecommunications as regards collection and dissemination of meteorological data, and the need for scientific, administrative and operational traffic have developed substantially since the second telecommunications meeting of experts of the Consultative Parties held in Buenos Aires in 1969; 

Considering that the implementation of Recommendation VI-1 and VII-7, and participation in the programmes of the World Meteorological Organisation, particularly the World Weather Watch, require a thorough review and improvement of the network operating in the Antarctic; 

Recommend to their Governments that they: 

1.  Compile comprehensive data, each for its own part, on the types of traffic, modes of transmission, timing, frequencies of their telecommunications schedules and current equipment of their telecommunications programmes in the Antarctic, as well as on projects in the process of implementation and proposed improvements, in particular by designating, where appropriate, stations capable of replacing others in the event of breakdown; 

2.  Forward all such data to each of the other Consultative parties via diplomatic channels on the one hand and on the other by direct despatch to the departments concerned; 

3.  Arrange for a meeting of telecommunications experts to be held, on the initiative of the Government of the host country, before the Tenth Consultative Meeting, to analyse the data thus compiled, suggest desirable measures of harmonisation and put forward recommendations on improvements to be made in the operation of the telecommunications network in the Antarctic; 

4.  Request SCAR through their National Antarctic Committees to undertake, at the earliest opportunity, a study of the most recent applications of science and technology to the specific problems of the Antarctic in the field of propagation of radio waves, and to pass on its conclusions to the Consultative Parties prior to their Tenth Meeting or if necessary to the next Consultative Meetings.
