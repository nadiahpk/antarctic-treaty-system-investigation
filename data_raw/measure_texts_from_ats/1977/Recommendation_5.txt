Recommendation IX-5 (ATCM IX - London, 1977)

MAN'S IMPACT ON THE ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT

The Representatives, 

Recommend to their Governments that they approve the following declaration on the Protection of the Antarctic Environment: 

The Governments participating in the Ninth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, 

Deeply aware that the Antarctic environment is unique and vulnerable to contamination and disturbance; 

Determined to protect the Antarctic environment from harmful interference; 

Having particular regard to the conservation principles developed by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) of the International Council of Scientific Unions; 

Recalling their obligation to exert appropriate efforts, consistent with the Charter of the United Nations, to the end that no one engages in any activity in Antarctica contrary to the principles or purposes of the Antarctic Treaty; 

Declare as follows: 

1. The Consultative Parties recognise their prime responsibility for the protection of the Antarctic environment from all forms of harmful human interference; 

2. They will ensure in planning future activities that the question of environmental effects and of the possible impact of such activities on the relevant ecosystems are duly considered; 

3. They will refrain from activities having an inherent tendency to modify the Antarctic environment unless appropriate steps have been taken to foresee the probable modifications and to exercise appropriate controls with respect to harmful environmental effects;   

4. They will continue to monitor the Antarctic environment and to exercise their responsibility for informing the world community of any significant changes in the Antarctic Treaty Area caused by manâ€™s activities.
