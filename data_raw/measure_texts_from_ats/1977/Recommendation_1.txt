Recommendation IX-1 (ATCM IX - London, 1977)

ANTARCTIC MINERAL RESOURCES

The Representatives, 

Recalling the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty, which establishes a regime for international co-operation in Antarctica, with the objective of ensuring that Antarctica should continue forever to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and should not become the scene or object of international discord; 

Bearing in mind the provisions of Article IV of the Treaty; 

Convinced that the framework established by the Antarctic Treaty has proved effective in promoting international harmony in furtherance of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, in ensuring the protection of the Antarctic environment, and on promoting freedom of scientific research in Antarctica; 

Noting with thanks the Report of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) Group of Specialists entitled Preliminary Assessment of the Environmental Impact of Mineral Exploration/Exploitation in Antarctica (EAMREA); 

Recognizing nevertheless that adequate scientific data concerning the harmful environmental effects of activities related to the exploration and exploitation of Antarctic mineral resources, should they occur, are not yet available; 

Concerned that unregulated activities related to exploration and exploitation of mineral resources could adversely affect the unique environment of the Antarctic and other ecosystems dependent on the Antarctic environment; 

Conscious that the Consultative Parties to the Antarctic Treaty in carrying out scientific research in the area have accumulated valuable experience and can substantially contribute to the protection of the environment and the rational use of Antarctic mineral resources, should exploration or exploitation thereof occur; 

Aware of the special responsibilities of Consultative Parties to ensure that any activities in Antarctica, including commercial exploration and exploitation in the future, should they occur, should not become the cause of international discord, of danger to the unique Antarctic environment, of disruption to scientific investigation, or be otherwise contrary to the principles or purposes of the Antarctic Treaty; 

Recommend to their Governments that: 

1.  They reaffirm the basic principles set forth in Recommendation VIII-14 of the Eighth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting; 

2.  They take note with appreciation of the Report of the Group of Experts on Mineral Exploration and Exploitation annexed to the Report of the Ninth Consultative Meeting and make the best possible use of its conclusions and guidelines; 

3.  They continue to study the environmental implications of mineral resource activities in the Antarctic Treaty Area and hold at a time and place to be arranged through diplomatic channels a meeting of ecological, technological and other related experts, in accordance with Recommendation IV-24, with a view to developing scientific programmes aimed at: 

     (i)  improving predictions of the impact of possible technologies for mineral exploration and exploitation in the Antarctic, as outlined in Section IIB of the Report of the Group of Experts, and in Section 5 of the SCAR/EAMREA Group Report; 

    (ii) developing measures for the prevention of damage to the environment or for its rehabilitation, in accordance with Section IIC of the Report of the Group of Experts; 

4.  They endorse the following principles elaborated at the Special Preparatory Meeting held in Paris from 28 June to 10 July 1976:

    (i)   the Consultative Parties will continue to play an active and responsible role in dealing with the question of the mineral resources of Antarctica; 

    (ii)  the Antarctic Treaty must be maintained in its entirety; 

    (iii) protection of the unique Antarctic environment and of its dependent ecosystems should be a basic consideration; 

    (iv) the Consultative Parties, in dealing with the question of mineral resources in Antarctica, should not prejudice the interests of all mankind in Antarctica; 

5.  They note that the provisions of Article IV of the Antarctic Treaty shall not be affected by the regime.  It should ensure that the principles embodied in Article IV of the Antarctic Treaty are safeguarded in application to the area covered by the Antarctic Treaty; 

6.  They study the content of a future regime based on the principles contained in paragraphs 4 and 5 and on such further principles, rules and arrangements as may be agreed, taking full account of all proposals submitted to the IXth Consultative Meeting; 

7.  The subject "Antarctic Resources - The Question of Mineral Exploration and Exploitation" be the subject of intensified consultation among them and they urge the host Government of the Tenth Consultative Meeting to convene a meeting to consider legal and political aspects of mineral resource issues; this meeting to report to the Tenth Consultative Meeting on the results of its work; 

8.  They urge their nationals and other States to refrain from all exploration and exploitation of Antarctic mineral resources while making progress towards the timely adoption of an agreed regime concerning Antarctic mineral resource activities.  They will thus endeavour to ensure that, pending the timely adoption of agreed solutions pertaining to exploration and exploitation of mineral resources, no activity shall be conducted to explore or exploit such resources.  They will keep these matters under continuing examination; 

9.  The subject "Antarctic Resources - The Question of Mineral Exploration and Exploitation" be placed on the Agenda of the Tenth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.
