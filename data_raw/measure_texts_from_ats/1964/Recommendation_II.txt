Recommendation III-II (ATCM III - Brussels, 1964)

NOTIFICATION OF UNOCCUPIED REFUGES

1. The Representatives recommend to their Governments that they should exchange through diplomatic channels, before the end of November each year, lists of all unoccupied buildings, huts or caches (hereinafter referred to as refuges) maintained by them in the Treaty Area in a condition suitable for use in emergencies. 

2. Such lists should include: 
    i)   The name and position of each refuge. 
    ii)   A description of its location. 
    iii)  The date on which it was established. 
    iv) The approximate date on which it was last examined. 
    v)  An estimate of the available accommodation, facilities, food, fuel and supplies of other kinds.   
  Any changes should be reported before the end of June of the following year. 

3. The Representatives further recommend that Governments whose expeditions use any refuge should report as rapidly as possible on any such use. Such Governments should also furnish an estimate of the amount of supplies which remain and a report about the condition of the refuge after use; in addition they should:  
 (a) Ensure that supplies available at these refuges are used only under emergency conditions. 
 (b) To the extent possible, and as early as possible, replenish the supplies consumed and inform the authorities who maintain the refuge of the action taken.
