Recommendation III-I (ATCM III - Brussels, 1964)

INFORMATION ON FACILITIES FOR THE LANDING OF AIRCRAFT

The Representatives, taking into account Recommendation I-VI (8) of the First Consultative Meeting, recommend to their Governments that they exchange, within the framework of Recommendation I-VI (8), information on airfield facilities in the Antarctic Treaty Area.  This information should include particulars of location, operating conditions and limitations, radio aids to navigation, facilities for radio communications and instrument landing, and be in detail sufficient to enable an aircraft to make a safe landing.
