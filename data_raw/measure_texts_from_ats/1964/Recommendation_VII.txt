Recommendation III-VII (ATCM III - Brussels, 1964)

ACCEPTANCE OF APPROVED RECOMMENDATIONS

Since the Recommendations approved by the Contracting Parties entitled to participate in meetings held in accordance with Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty are so much a part of the overall structure of cooperation established by the Treaty, 

the Representatives recommend to their Governments that any new Contracting Party entitled to participate in such meetings should be urged to accept these recommendations and to inform other Contracting Parties of its intention to apply and be bound by them.

The Representatives recommend further that their Governments agree that existing Contracting Parties and any new Contracting Parties other than those entitled to participate in meetings held in accordance with Article IX of the Treaty be invited to consider accepting these recommendations and to inform other Contracting Parties of their intention to apply and be bound by them.
