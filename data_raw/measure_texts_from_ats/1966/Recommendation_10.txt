Recommendation IV-10 (ATCM IV - Santiago, 1966)

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS: BYERS PENINSULA

The Representatives, 

considering that Byers Peninsula supports a considerable diversity of plant and animal life, including many invertebrates, that a substantial population of Elephant Seals (Mirounga leonina) and small colonies of Fur Seals (Arctocephalus sp.) are found on the beaches, that Fur Seals breed on Window Island and that the close association of such a large variety of Antarctic plants and animals within a relatively small area is of outstanding scientific interest, 

recommend to their Governments that the following be inserted in Annex B, Specially Protected Areas, of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora:

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREA No 10

Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands

Lat 62°38'S, long 61°05'W

DESCRIPTION:  The ice-free peninsula lying to the west of the western margin of the permanent ice sheet on Livingston Island.  The five small ice-free areas on the south coast immediately to the east are also included.  Window Island is included within the area, but no other off-lying islands and rocks.  The area is shown on the attached map.
