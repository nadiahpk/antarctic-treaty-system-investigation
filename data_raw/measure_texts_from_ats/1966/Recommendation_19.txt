Recommendation IV-19 (ATCM IV - Santiago, 1966)

IMPLEMENTATION OF ARTICLE XII (1) (d) OF THE AGREED MEASURES

The Representatives recommend to their Governments that for the effective implementation of the provisions of Article XII of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora, documents exchanged annually by Participating Governments on the matters set down in paragraph 1(a) of that Article should follow the pattern of the form annexed hereto.  

Recognizing the role of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), as defined in Recommendation I-IV, the Representatives further welcome the decision of SCAR to study the status of species, their need for protection and numbers of each species which might be harvested for food, study or other uses, as outlined in paragraph 1(b) and (c) of Article XII of the Agreed Measures.
