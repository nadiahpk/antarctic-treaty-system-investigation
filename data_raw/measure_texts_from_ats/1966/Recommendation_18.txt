The Representatives, 

taking into consideration Article VI of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora (Recommendation III-VIII), 

recommend to their Governments that in cases where expeditions of more than one Participating Government may be working in the same region of the Treaty Area, the Governments involved should arrange to co-operate as far as practicable in limiting the issuance of permits in accordance with Article VI to ensure that the total number of native mammals and birds killed or captured accords with the requirements of paragraphs 4 and 7(b) of Article VI and paragraph 4(b) of Article VIII of the Agreed Measures.
