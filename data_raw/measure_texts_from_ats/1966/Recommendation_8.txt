Recommendation IV-8 (ATCM IV - Santiago, 1966)

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS: DION ISLANDS

The Representatives, 

considering that amongst the Dion Islands is found the only colony of Emperor Penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) known to exist on the west side of the Antarctic Peninsula and that the isolation of this colony from others of the same species makes it of outstanding scientific interest, 

recommend to their Governments that the following be inserted in Annex B, Specially Protected Areas, of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora:

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREA No 8

Dion Islands, Marguerite Bay, Antarctic Peninsula

Lat 67°52'S, long 68°43'W

DESCRIPTION:  A group of small, rocky, low-lying islands in Marguerite Bay, about 15 kilometres south of Adelaide Island.  The area is shown on the attached map.
