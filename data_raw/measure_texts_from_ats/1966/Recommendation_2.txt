Recommendation IV-2 (ATCM IV - Santiago, 1966)

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS: ROOKERY ISLANDS

The Representatives, 

considering that Rookery Islands contain breeding colonies of all six bird species resident in the Mawson area, two of which, the Giant Petrel (Macronectes giganteus)  and the Cape Pigeon (Daption capensis), occur nowhere else in the region and that it is of scientific importance to safeguard this unusual association of six species and to preserve a sample of their habitat, 

recommend to their Governments that the following be inserted in Annex B, Specially Protected Areas, of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora:

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREA No 2

Rookery Islands, Holme Bay

Lat 67°37'S, long 62°33'E.

DESCRIPTION:  The area, 7 nautical miles west of Mawson, comprises the islands and rocks lying within the rectangle marked on the attached map.
