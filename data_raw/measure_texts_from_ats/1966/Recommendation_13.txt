Recommendation IV-13 (ATCM IV - Santiago, 1966)

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS: MOE ISLAND

considering that Moe Island provides a representative sample of the maritime Antarctic ecosystem, that intensive experimental research on the neighbouring Signy Island may alter its ecosystem and that Moe Island should be specially protected as a control area for future comparison, 

recommend to their Governments that the following be inserted in Annex B, Specially Protected Areas, of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora:

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREA No 13

Moe Island, South Orkney Islands

Lat 60°45'S, long 45°41'W

DESCRIPTION:  A small island, about 1 kilometre long and 1 kilometre across, lying about 500 metres south-west of Signy Island, South Orkney Islands.  The off-lying rocks are not included in the area.  The area is shown on the attached map.
