Recommendation IV-9 (ATCM IV - Santiago, 1966)

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS: GREEN ISLAND

The Representatives, 

considering that the vegetation on Green Island is exceptionally rich, that it is probably the most luxuriant anywhere on the west side of the Antarctic Peninsula, that in some places the humus is 2 metres thick and that this area, being of outstanding scientific interest, should be protected because it is probably one of the most diverse Antarctic ecosystems, 

recommend to their Governments that the following be inserted in Annex B, Specially Protected Areas, of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora:

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREA No 9

Green Island, Berthelot Islands, Antarctic Peninsula

Lat 65°19'S, long 64°10'W

DESCRIPTION:  A small island, measuring about 600 metres by 400 metres, situated 150 metres to the north of the largest of the Berthelot Islands.  The area is shown on the attached map.
