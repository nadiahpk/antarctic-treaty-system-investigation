considering that Cape Shirreff supports a considerable diversity of plant and animal life, including many invertebrates, that a substantial population of Elephant Seals (Mirounga leonina) and small colonies of Fur Seals (Arctocephalus sp.) are found on the beaches and that the area is of outstanding scientific interest, 

recommend to their Governments that the following be inserted in Annex B, Specially Protected Areas, of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora:

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREA No 11
