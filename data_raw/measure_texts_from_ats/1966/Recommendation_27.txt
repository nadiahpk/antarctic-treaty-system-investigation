Recommendation IV-27 (ATCM IV - Santiago, 1966)

EFFECTS OF ANTARCTIC TOURISM

Recognizing that the effects of tourist activities may prejudice the conduct of scientific research, conservation of fauna and flora and the operation of Antarctic stations, 

The Representatives recommend to their Governments that: 

1.  The Government of a country in which a tourist or other non-scientific expedition is being organized furnish notice of the expedition as soon as possible through diplomatic channels to any other Government whose station the expedition plans to visit; 

2.  A Government provide on request information as promptly as possible regarding the conditions upon which it would grant permission for tourist groups to visit Antarctic stations which it maintains; and 

3.  Such permission be withheld unless reasonable assurances are given of compliance with the provisions of the Treaty, the Recommendations then effective and the conditions applicable at stations to be visited.
