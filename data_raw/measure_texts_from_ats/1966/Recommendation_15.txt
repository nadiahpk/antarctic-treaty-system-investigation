Recommendation IV-15 (ATCM IV - Santiago, 1966)

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS: SOUTHERN POWELL ISLAND AND ADJACENT ISLANDS

The Representatives, 

considering that southern Powell Island and the adjacent islands support substantial vegetation and a considerable bird and mammal fauna, which is representative of the natural ecology of the South Orkney Islands, and which is rendered more important by the presence of the nucleus of an expanding colony of Fur Seals (Arctocephalus tropicalis gazella), recommend to their Governments that the following be inserted in Annex B, Specially Protected Areas, of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora:

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREA No 15

Southern Powell Island and adjacent islands, South Orkney Islands

Lat 60°45'S, long 45°02'W

DESCRIPTION:  This area in the central South Orkney Islands includes that part of Powell Island which is south of the latitude of the southern summit of John Peaks, together with the whole of Fredriksen Island, Michelsen Island, Christoffersen Island, Grey Island and the unnamed islands lying within the rectangle marked on the attached map.
