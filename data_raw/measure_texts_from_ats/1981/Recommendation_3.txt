Recommendation XI-3 (ATCM XI - Buenos Aires, 1981)

AIR DISASTER ON MOUNT EREBUS

The Representatives, 

Recalling with respect that in the years of exploration and research many have travelled to and worked in Antarctica and not returned; 

Noting that on November 28, 1979 two hundred and fifty seven people of several nationalities lost their lives when the aircraft in which they were travelling crashed into the slopes of Mount Erebus, Ross Island, Antarctica; 

Aware that in spite of the determined and courageous action of members of the New Zealand and United States Antarctic expeditions the bodies of some of those who died could not be recovered; 

Aware, too, that no permanent memorial may be placed on the ice slopes at the site of the tragedy; 

Express their deep sympathy with the relatives of those who died and with the Government and people of New Zealand; and

Recommend to their Governments that the site on the northern slopes of Mount Erebus where the accident took place be declared a tomb and that they ensure that the area is left in peace.
