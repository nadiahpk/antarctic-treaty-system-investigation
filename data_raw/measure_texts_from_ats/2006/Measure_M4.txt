Measure 4 (2006) - ATCM XXIX - CEP IX, Edinburgh

Specially Protected Species: 
Fur Seals

The Representatives

Recalling Article 3 of Annex II to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty ("the Protocol"), providing for the designation of Specially Protected Species to be accorded special protection by the Parties;

Further recalling that the Committee for Environmental Protection ("CEP") adopted at CEP VIII guidelines for consideration of proposals for new and revised designations of Specially Protected Species, under which risk of extinction is to be assessed using criteria established by the IUCN; 

Noting that SCAR has determined that the Antarctic Fur Seal (Arctocephalus gazella) and the Sub-antarctic Fur Seal (Arctocephalus tropicalis) are no longer at significant risk of extinction, and that as these are the only two species of the genus Arctocephalus in the Antarctic Treaty area, the genus Arctocephalus should be removed from the list of Specially Protected Species;

Further noting that the CEP has assessed the implications of removing these species from the list of Specially Protected Species, and has advised that they be removed;

Welcoming the recovery of the population and range of the Antarctic Fur Seal and the Sub-antarctic Fur Seal;

Believing that, in the light of the scientific advice from SCAR, the Antarctic Fur Seal and the Sub-antarctic Fur Seal should now be removed from the list of Specially Protected Species contained in Appendix A to Annex II to the Protocol;

Recognizing that the Antarctic Fur Seal and the Sub-antarctic Fur Seal will continue to receive comprehensive protection under the Protocol, and that their delisting will have no implications for the protection of those species of the genus Arctocephalus that occur only outside the Antarctic Treaty area;

Further noting that the Ross Seal (Ommatophoca rossii) remains a Specially Protected Species;

Bearing in mind the historical exploitation of fur seals in the region that made necessary the special protection of the Antarctic Fur Seal and the Sub-antarctic Fur Seal, and the deep public interest in the protection and conservation of fur seals in Antarctica;

Resolving to keep under review the conservation status of fur seals in the Antarctic Treaty area;

Urging those Consultative Parties which are members of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources to continue to provide data on the amount of incidental seal mortality, potential impacts of krill harvesting on seal populations, and the development and effectiveness of mitigation measures in the krill fishery;

Recommend to their governments the following Measure for approval in accordance with Article 9 of Annex II to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty:

That:
In Appendix A to Annex II to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, the words "All species of the genus Arctocephalus, Fur Seals." be deleted.
