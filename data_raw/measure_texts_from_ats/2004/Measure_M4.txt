Measure 4 (2004) - ATCM XXVII - CEP VII, Capetown

INSURANCE AND CONTINGENCY PLANNING FOR TOURISM AND  NON GOVERNMENTAL ACTIVITIES IN THE ANTARCTIC TREATY AREA

The Representatives,

Concerned at the potential impacts, including the imposition of additional costs, that tourist or other non-governmental activities may have on national programmes, and the risks to the safety of those involved in search and rescue operations;

Desiring to ensure that tourist or other non-governmental activities undertaken in Antarctica are carried out in a safe and self-sufficient manner;

Desiring further to ensure that the risks associated with tourism or other non-governmental activities are fully identified in advance, and minimised;

Noting that the "Procedures to be Followed by Organisers and Operators", as set out in the Attachment to Recommendation XVIII-1, contain some elements relating to self-sufficiency and insurance;

Recommend to their Governments the following Measure for approval in accordance with paragraph 4 of Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty:

That Parties shall require those under their jurisdiction organising or conducting tourist or other non-governmental activities in the Antarctic Treaty Area, for which advance notification is required in accordance with Article VII (5) of the Antarctic Treaty, to demonstrate compliance with the following requirements:

- that appropriate contingency plans and sufficient arrangements for health and safety, search and rescue (SAR), and medical care and evacuation have been drawn up and are in place prior to the start of the activity.  Such plans and arrangements shall not be reliant on support from other operators or national programmes without their express written agreement; and

- that adequate insurance or other arrangements are in place to cover any costs associated with search and rescue and medical care and evacuation.
