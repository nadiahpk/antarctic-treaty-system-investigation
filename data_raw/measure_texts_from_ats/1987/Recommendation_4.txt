FACILITATION OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH: SITES OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST: INTERIM GUIDELINES:
EXTENSION OF DESIGNATION

The Representatives,

Recalling Recommendations VIII-3, VIII-4, X-6, XII-5 and XIII-7;

Noting that:

(i) in accordance with paragraph 2 of Recommendation VIII-3 the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) at its Nineteenth Meeting at San Diego, USA in June 1986, had reviewed the Site of Special Scientific Interest No 2 and had noted the importance of protecting this site from man-made electromagnetic interference over a range of frequencies from 10(-2) Hz to 10(8) Hz in view of the value of the site for the study of natural electromagnetic phenomena of relevance to ionospheric and  magnetospheric physics;

(ii) experience of the practical effect of the management plan for the site had shown it to be an effective means of reducing the risks of harmful interference with the scientific research being undertaken in it;

(iii) no change to the management plan had been proposed by SCAR;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. The date of expiry of designation of Site Number 2 be extended from 31 December 1987 to 31 December 1997.   

2. They use their best endeavours to ensure, in accordance with paragraphs 3 and 4 of Recommendation VIII-3 that the management plan for this site is observed.
