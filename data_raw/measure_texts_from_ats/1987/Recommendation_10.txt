Recommendation XIV-10 (ATCM XIV - Rio de Janeiro, 1987)

MARINE METEOROLOGICAL AND SEA ICE INFORMATION SERVICES FOR NAVIGATION IN THE TREATY AREA OF THE SOUTHERN OCEAN

Recalling Article II of the Antarctic Treaty and Recommendations relating to co-operation with regard to Antarctic logistics (II-V, III-3, IV-25) and Antarctic meteorology and telecommunication (I-II, II-3, III-5, IV-26, V-2, VI-1, VI-3, VII-7, IX-3, X-3, XII-1, XII-2); 

Aware of numerous cases when ships have been lost or beset in Antarctic sea ice for long periods; 

Aware 

 (i) of increasing interest in the science and operational relevance of Antarctic meteorology and sea ice studies on the part of the WMO, SCAR, and IOC as indicated by existing research projects of these international bodies;
 (ii) of advances in satellite monitoring of marine meteorological and sea ice conditions and of the consequent improvement in the quality, reliability and content of their assessment and prediction;
 (iii) of the strides that have been made in predicting optimal ship routings with respect to marine meteorological and sea ice conditions;
 (iv) of existing marine meteorological and sea ice services;
 
Considering advances in telecommunication and the exchange of marine meteorological and sea ice information;

Desiring to apply the benefits of these developments to the improvement of real time data utilization and prediction of weather, sea ice, currents and sea-state conditions (particularly in the sea ice zone) with a view to further increasing the efficiency and the safety of navigation;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1.  They invite WMO and SCAR (through their Permanent Representatives and their National Committees, respectively) to consider ways of improving or developing operational marine meteorological and sea ice information services in the Treaty Area of the Southern Ocean; 

2.  Any such consideration should take into account the Implementation Programme for the Antarctic described in Annex I of the Final Report of the Fourth Session of the EC Working Group on Antarctic Meteorology (September 1986), and subsequent pertinent decisions of the Tenth WMO Congress (May 1987);

3.  Such consideration be coordinated with the IOC;

4. After receiving a response from WMO and SCAR, they convene, if necessary, in accordance with Recommendation IV-24, a Meeting of Experts to consider how an improved approach to marine meteorological and sea ice information services in the Treaty Area of the Southern Ocean could be implemented.
