The Representatives, 

Conscious of the value of increasing public knowledge of the achievements and operation of the Antarctic Treaty System; 

Noting operative paragraph 4 of Recommendation XII-6, subparagraph (c) of which is no longer relevant; 

Desiring to modify subparagraphs (a) and (b) of the said operative paragraph 4, which deal with the handling of Information Documents; 

Recommend to their Governments that operative paragraph 4 of Recommendation XII-6 be replaced by the following: 

"4. Starting with the XVth Consultative Meeting, Delegations should indicate, when submitting an Information Document, if they intend that document not to be made public. In the absence of such an indication, the Document will be publicly available as from the closure of the Meeting at which it was submitted."
