Recommendation XIV-6 (ATCM XIV - Rio de Janeiro, 1987)

MARINE SITES OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST

The Representatives,  
 
Recalling Article II of the Antarctic Treaty, Recommendation VII-3 and VIII-3;   

Conscious of the need to protect marine scientific investigations which might suffer from willful or accidental interference;   

Desiring to protect inshore marine sites of scientific interest where harmful interference is generally recognized to be likely;   

Recognizing the need to protect such marine scientific investigations;   

Recognizing that a limited number of inshore marine sites of exceptional scientific interest may require long-term protection from harmful interference;   

Recommend to their Governments that:  

1. They invite SCAR through their National Committees, to have regard to the following when considering proposals for marine Sites of Special Scientific Interest:   

 (a) Marine sites should be proposed only when:     
     (i) marine scientific investigations are being carried out or are planned to begin before the following meeting of SCAR, and there is a demonstrable risk of interference which would jeopardize those scientific investigations; or     
     (ii) they are of exceptional scientific interest and therefore require a measure of long-term protection from harmful interference.   

 (b) Marine sites should be proposed for designation up to a specified date, which may be extended following a review by SCAR;   

 (c) Proposals for the designation of marine sites should be accompanied by management plans which should include inter alia, and where applicable, the following details:     
     (i) A description of the Marine Site, together with a map delimiting  its boundaries;     
     (ii) A statement setting out the reasons in conformity with paragraphs 1(a)(i) and (ii) above for designation of the marine site;     
     (iii) A description of the scientific investigations being carried out or planned;     
     (iv) The proposed date at which the designation will expire unless extended; 
     (v)  If adjacent to the coast, proposed points of access;     
     (vi) Other kinds of scientific investigations which would not cause harmful interference with the investigations described at paragraph  (c)(iii) above;     
     (vii) Whether specific kinds of scientific sampling may take place and  guidelines for such sampling. 

2. They invite SCAR, through their National Committees to initiate review of those marine sites whose designation is likely to terminate before the second following Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting. 

3. They request their national offices responsible for Antarctic activities to maintain a record of activities within each marine site of Special Scientific Interest in which their scientists are active. 

4. Scientists wishing to work within marine Sites of Special Scientific Interest should consult their national offices responsible for Antarctic activities to obtain authorization.
