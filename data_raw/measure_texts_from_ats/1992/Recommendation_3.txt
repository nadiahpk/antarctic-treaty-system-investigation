The Representatives,

Recalling Recommendations I-IX, V-4, VI-14, VII-9, XII-7, XIII-16 and XIV-8;

Recommend to their Governments that the following historic monuments be added to the "List of Historic Monuments Identified and Described by the Proposing Government or Governments" annexed to Recommendation VII-9, and that thereafter they be accorded the respect and protection required by the Recommendation recalled above:

Wooden plaque and rock cairn located at Penguins Bay, southern coast of Seymour Island (Marambio), James Ross Archipelago (64°16'00"S - 56°39'10"W).  This plaque was placed on 10 November 1903 by the crew of a rescue mission of the Argentinian Corvette "Uruguay" in the site where they met members of the Swedish expedition led by Dr. Otto Nordenskjöld.  The text of the wooden plaque reads as follows:

10.XI.1903  "Uruguay" (Argentine Navy) in its journey to give assistance to the Swedish Antarctic expedition.

In January 1990, a rock cairn was erected by Argentina in memory of this event in the place where the plaque is located.
