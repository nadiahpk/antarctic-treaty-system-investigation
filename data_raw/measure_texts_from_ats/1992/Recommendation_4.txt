Recommendation XVII-4 (ATCM XVII - Venice, 1992)

GLOBAL CHANGE RESEARCH AND INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN ANTARCTICA

The Representatives,

Recalling Articles II and III of the Antarctic Treaty and Article VI of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, and Recommendation XV-14 on the promotion of international scientific cooperation;

Reaffirming the Declaration adopted at the XVIth Consultative Meeting on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the entry into force of the Antarctic Treaty;

Noting the recognition in Agenda 21 of the United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development of the importance of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean for the study of global change processes;

Acknowledging the role that intensified coordination of national research programmes and increased international cooperation should play, such as SCAR’s publication on "the role of Antarctica in global change";

Conscious as well that the development of an implementation plan for an Antarctic research contribution to the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme represents a significant step to be accomplished during the Decade of International Antarctic Scientific Cooperation (1991-2000) proclaimed by the XVIth ATCM;

Recommend to their Governments that they:

1.  welcome the decision adopted by the Scientific Committee for Antarctic Research at XXII SCAR to establish a new group of specialists on global change and the Antarctic, in order to provide linkages and communications between national programmes, SCAR Working Group and other Groups of Specialists in areas of relevant Antarctic research;

2.  encourage SCAR to articulate, in close cooperation with COMNAP, a management structure to implement a coordinated programme for global change research in the Antarctic and to contribute through the development of Regional Research Centres (RRCs) to the IGBP System for Analysis, Research and Training (START) and to other major regional and international programmes on global change research;

3.  support initiatives such as the proposal of the SCAR Working Group on Biology and the offer made by Chile to hold a workshop on the coordination of biological research on King George Island (Isla 25 de Mayo); the Cooperative Geoscience of the South Shetland Islands (COGS) whose second workshop was sponsored by the National Institute of Polar Research of Japan; and similar initiatives to coordinate research in glaciology and solar-terrestrial studies;

4.  note with appreciation the completion of SCAR’s proposal for coordinated Antarctic research (The role of Antarctica in global change: part 2) to be published late in 1992 and the plan to implement a regional program of global change research in the Antarctic, through:

i) continuing identification of high priority research needs in process studies, monitoring, and modelling;
ii) identifying other needs in the implementation of the programme, such as logistics, data management, etc;
iii) organising workshops and symposia to synthesise and discuss research results;

5.  that the above mentioned regional programme of Global Change research in the Antarctic should be given a high scientific priority and supported to the greater extent feasible by Governments;

6.  may consider applying to the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and other acceptable funding mechanisms to support the proposed new group of specialists and their work.
