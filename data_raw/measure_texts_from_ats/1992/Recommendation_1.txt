Recommendation XVII-1 (ATCM XVII - Venice, 1992)

ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND DATA MANAGEMENT

The Representatives,

Recalling Recommendations XV-5, XV-16, XVI-12 and paragraphs 106-109 of the Report of the XVIth ATCM;

Noting the report and the valuable work of the First Meeting of Experts on Environmental Monitoring in Antarctica (XVII ATCM/INFO 9) and the recommendations set forth in the afore mentioned report;

Noting that better data management can improve the quality of Antarctic Environmental Monitoring, operations and science;

Noting additionally the report by SCAR-COMNAP (XVII ATCM/WP 5) describing actions that could be taken to develop a coordinated data management system with the intent to improve the comparability and accessibility of both scientific and environmental data being collected by national programmes, as called for by ATCM Recommendations XIII-5 and XV-16.

Recognizing that, in the Final Act of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, it was agreed that it was desirable to ensure effective implementation at an early date; and that paragraph 69 of the Report of the XVIth ATCM exhorts the Consultative Parties to ratify the Protocol as soon as possible, and that meanwhile efforts also should be made to implement the provisions of the Annexes as rapidly and completely as possible.

Acknowledging that in order to meet the requirements of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty that calls, under Articles 3.2 (d) and 3.2 (e), for regular and effective monitoring, to allow assessment of the adverse impacts of human activities, it is necessary to focus environment impact monitoring particularly on anthropogenic effects at a local level;

Aware that once established, the Committee for Environmental Protection may offer its advice on these measures, consistent with its terms of reference as provided for in the Protocol;

Aware that applied monitoring can be expensive and may require long term commitment and that any environmental monitoring should be scientifically defensible, practicable and cost-effective;

Recommend to their Governments that they:

1.  Through their SCAR National Committees request SCAR to consider and provide advice on:

(i) The types of long-term programmes, if any, necessary to verify that human activities (such as tourism, scientific research or other activities) do not have significant adverse effects on birds, seals and plants; and
(ii) emission standards that should be established to ensure that the combustion of fossil fuels and incineration of waste do not contaminate the Antarctic atmosphere, terrestrial, ice, aquatic or marine environments in a way that would compromise their scientific values;

2.  Ask their COMNAP Representatives in consultation with SCAR to establish research programmes at a representative subset of facilities in Antarctica to determine how different types and sizes of facilities in different localities (eg. coastal and inland stations on rocks and on ice shelves) affect the Antarctic environment;

3.  Provide a list of the Antarctic data sets being compiled and archived by their nationals and make this list available to other Parties, SCAR and COMNAP, as soon as possible, to form the basis for the development of an Antarctic Data Directory;

4.  Establish, as appropriate, national arrangements for obtaining expert advice on the types of data products and data access mechanisms which would best meet both the basic scientific requirements and long-term environmental monitoring requirements.
