Recommendation XIII-5 (ATCM XIII - Brussels, 1985)

MAN'S IMPACT ON THE ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT : ADDITIONAL PROTECTIVE ARRANGEMENTS

The Representatives, 

Recalling the measures adopted under the Antarctic Treaty for the protection of the environment, the protection of historic sites and monuments, the conservation of fauna and flora, and in particular the setting aside of Specially Protected Areas and Sites of Special Scientific Interest; 

Desiring to ensure that activities in Antarctica should not harm the unique Antarctic environment, disrupt scientific investigations or other legitimate uses or be otherwise contrary to the principles and purposes of the Antarctic Treaty; 

Bearing in mind that the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) at the XVIIIth Meeting in Bremerhaven considered the question of the establishment of a new type of conservation area in the Antarctic; 

Recommend to their Governments that through their National Committees they invite the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) to offer scientific advice: 

1. on the system of protected areas in the Antarctic, including Sites of Special Scientific Interest and Specially Protected Areas and the question of a possible additional category of area under a different form of protection; and

2. on steps that possibly could be taken to improve the comparability and accessibility of scientific data on Antarctica.
