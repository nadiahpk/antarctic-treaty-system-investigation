Recommendation XIII-6 (ATCM XIII - Brussels, 1985)

FACILITATION OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH : SITING OF STATIONS

The Representatives, 

Recalling Recommendations I-I, VI-4, VII-1, VII-8, VIII-11 and XII-3; 

Reaffirming that freedom of scientific investigation as set out in Article II of the Antarctic Treaty is one of the fundamental principles of the Treaty; and 

Noting that nothing in this recommendation may be construed as prejudicing that provision of the Treaty; 

Recognizing that, while there are scientific, environmental and logistic advantages to be gained from stations being in proximity to one another, there can also be disadvantages which can be avoided by appropriate consultation; 

Recommend to their Governments that where stations have been established in the same vicinity the concerned national Antarctic operating agencies should consult together, by whatever means found appropriate, so as to safeguard existing scientific activities, avoid operational logistic difficulties and avoid undue adverse environmental effects arising from cumulative impacts.
