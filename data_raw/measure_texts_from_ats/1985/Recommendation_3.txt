Recommendation XIII-3 (ATCM XIII - Brussels, 1985)

EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ANTARCTIC TREATY : ANNUAL EXCHANGES

The Representatives, 

Recalling Articles III and VII of the Antarctic Treaty and Recommendations VIII-6 and VIII-9; 

Considering that while it is important that Consultative Parties should continue to report extensions, reductions or other modifications of activities previously reported, no practical purpose is served by requiring this information to be provided in the Antarctic winter; 

Recalling the need to maintain an awareness of the activities of tourists in the Antarctic Treaty Area; 

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. Operative paragraph 4 of Recommendation VIII-6 be amended as follows:

          replace the date "30 June" with the date "30 November";

2. The Annex to Recommendation VIII-6 be amended as follows:

          Paragraph 2: replace the date "30 June" with the date "30 November"; 

          Paragraph 3: add "XVI. The reports referred to in paragraph 3 of Recommendation VIII-9."
