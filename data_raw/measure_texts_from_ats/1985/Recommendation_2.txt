Recommendation XIII-2 (ATCM XIII - Brussels, 1985)

OPERATION OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY SYSTEM: OVERVIEW

The Representatives, 

Recognizing the virtue of there being a regular overview of the Antarctic Treaty System, including the relationships among its components; 

Believing that regular reports about the activities of these components at the Consultative Meetings would serve this objective; 

Recommend to their Governments that: 

1.  An item "Operation of the Antarctic Treaty System: Reports" be included on the Agenda of each subsequent Consultative Meeting; 

2.  Under that item reports concerning developments in their respective areas of competence since the previous Consultative Meeting be received from the components of the system and that, to this end: 

    (a) they request the Chairman of any special Consultative Meeting, and of any other meeting held pursuant to a recommendation of a Consultative Meeting, or a person designated by him, to present such a report; 

    (b) they invite the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources to appoint its Chairman or other person to represent the Commission as an observer for the specific purpose of presenting such a report; 

    (c) through their National Committees, they invite the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) to appoint its President or other person to represent the Committee as an observer for the specific purpose of reporting on: 
         (i) the general proceedings of SCAR; 
         (ii) matters within the competence of SCAR under the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals; 
         (iii) such publications and reports as may have been published or prepared in accordance with Recommendations IV-19 and VI-9 respectively; 

    (d) pending possible establishment of a Commission as provided for under the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals, they invite the Depositary Government of that Convention to report on the matters within the Depositaryâ€™s competence under the Convention. 

3.  In preparing for each Consultative Meeting they consider, in relation to developments since the previous Consultative Meeting, whether, for the purpose of such overview, reports on any such developments in, or bearing upon, the Antarctic Treaty System would be helpful and, through the host Government for that Consultative Meeting, act accordingly.
