Recommendation XIII-11 (ATCM XIII - Brussels, 1985)

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREA: LAGOTELLERIE ISLAND, MARGUERITE BAY

The Representatives, 

Considering that Lagotellerie Island contains a relatively diverse flora typical of the southern Antarctic Peninsula region; that of particular interest is the abundance of the only two Antarctic flowering plants (Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus quitensis) which form closed stands up to 10 m2; that these are amongst the largest stands known south of the South Shetland Islands, being only 90 km north of their southern limit; that here both speices flower profusely and the seeds have a greater viability than those produced in the South Orkney and South Shetland Islands; that numerous mosses and lichens also form well developed communities on the island; that a few of the mosses are fertile, a rare phenomenon in most Antarctic localities; that the invertebrate fauna is rich and that the island is one of the southernmost sites for the apterous midge Belgica antarctica; that the shallow loamy soil developed beneath these swards and its associated invertebrate fauna and microbiota are probably unique at this latitude; that there is a colony of about 1000 Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica) and one of the farthest south colonies of a few dozen blue eyed cormorants (Phalacrocorax atriceps) at the south-east corner of the island and that numerous pairs of brown and south polar skuas (Catharacta lonnbergii and C. maccormicki) breed on the island;

Recommend to their Governments that the following area of outstanding scientific interest be inserted in Annex B, Specially Protected Areas, of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora :
