Recommendation XIII-4 (ATCM XIII - Brussels, 1985)

MAN'S IMPACT ON THE ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT : CODE OF CONDUCT FOR ANTARCTIC EXPEDITIONS AND STATION ACTIVITIES : WASTE DISPOSAL

The Representatives, 

Recalling Recommendations VI-4, VIII-11 and XII-4; 

Recognising that Antarctica derives much of its scientific importance from its uncontaminated condition and the consequent need to reduce to the minimum level practicable the spread of all potential contaminants introduced into the Antarctic Treaty Area by man; 

Noting that changes have occurred in the perception of what constitutes pollution and in analytical techniques since Recommendation VIII-11 was approved; 

Noting with appreciation the preliminary review by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) of the waste disposal aspects of the Annex to Recommendation VIII-11; 

Recommend to their respective Governments that through their National Antarctic Committees they invite SCAR, using all resources available to it, to undertake a comprehensive review of the waste disposal aspects of the Annex to Recommendations VIII-11 and, giving due consideration to the need to avoid detrimental effects on neighbouring or associated ecosystems outside the Antarctic Treaty Area and to considerations of cost-effectiveness, to offer:

1. scientific advice regarding waste disposal procedures and standards that it is desirable to achieve at coastal and inland stations and field camps;

2. advice regarding the logistic feasibility of such procedures bearing in mind Antarctic operational circumstances, including variation in the numbers of personnel between stations, operational and logistic difficulties, and local circumstances; and

3. such other advice as seems to SCAR to be relevant to waste disposal procedures.
