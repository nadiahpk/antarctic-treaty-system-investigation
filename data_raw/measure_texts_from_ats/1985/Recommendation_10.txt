Recommendation XIII-10 (ATCM XIII - Brussels, 1985)

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS : NORTH CORONATION ISLAND, SOUTH ORKNEY ISLANDS

The Representatives, 

Considering that the area bound by Foul Point and Conception Point on the north coast of Coronation Island, South Orkney Islands, extending southwards to Wave Peak and comprising Ommaney Bay and the bay between Prong Point and Conception Point embraces areas of coastal ice-free terrain (Conception, Prong and Foul Points) with large seabird colonies and lichen-dominated cliffs, and permanent ice rising to the Brisbane heights plateau which provides an excellent representative area of a pristine ice environment near the northern limit of the maritime Antarctic and the Antarctic Treaty area, and that the interrelated terrestrial, permanent ice and marine components of this area comprise an integrated example of the coastal, permanent ice and sublittoral ecosystems typical of the maritime Antarctic environment;

Recommend to their Governments that the following area of outstanding scientific interest be inserted in Annex B, Specially Protected Areas, of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora :

Specially Protected Area No 18
North Coronation Island, South Orkney Islands.  Between Lat. 60°31'S., Long. 45°41'W. and Lat. 60°37'S., Long. 45°36'W. and Lat. 60°32'S., Long. 45°29'W.

Description:  The area lies on the central north side of Coronation Island, South Orkney Islands.  It is bounded to the east by Foul Point (lat. 60°32'S, long. 45°29'W) and to the west by Conception Point (60°31'S, 45°41'W); the entire area of these points is included in the area.  The eastern boundary follows a precipitous ridge 6 km southwards to a position at 2500 ft (750m) altitude immediately to the west of Mt Nivea summit (60°35'S, 45°29'W), thence west-south-westwards for 5,5 km to a position at 3000 ft (900m) altitude to the north-east of Wave Peak summit (60°37'S, 45°36'W), and from there 2 km westwards across the Brisbane Heights plateau then 5 km north-west to an unnamed summit at 3532 ft (1060 m) and north for 6 km to Conception Point.  The summits of Mt Nivea and Wave Peak and the col known as High Stile are outside the area.  Ommaney Bay and the unnamed bay to the west are included within the area south of the boundary between Conception and Prong Points (11.5 km).  The area is shown on the attached map.
