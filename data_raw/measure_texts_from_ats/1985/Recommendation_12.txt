Recommendation XIII-12 (ATCM XIII - Brussels, 1985)

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS : "NEW COLLEGE VALLEY" , CAUGHLEY BEACH , CAPE BIRD , ROSS ISLAND
 
The Representatives, 

Considering that the area contains some of the most luxuriant stands of vegetation (algae, mosses and lichens) and associated microflora in the Ross Sea sector of Antarctica; that because of the susceptibility of the cryptogamic vegetation to damage from trampling, the designation of the area provides protection for its biota, so that the area may serve as a conservation reserve representative of the adjacent Site of Special Scientific Interest no. 10;

Recommend to their Governments that the following area of outstanding scientific interest be inserted in Annex B, Specially Protected Areas, of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora:

Specially Protected Area No. 20 
"New College Valley", Caughley Beach, Cape Bird, Ross Island
Lat. 77°14'S., Long. 166°23'E.

Description:  The area consists of the ice free terrain lying between the cliff top above Caughley Beach and about 100 m east of the Mt Bird Ice Cap, and between a line south of the main stream bed of "Keble Valley" and the south ridge of "New College Valley".  It is surrounded on three sides by Site of Special Scientific Interest no. 10.  The area is shown on the attached map A.
