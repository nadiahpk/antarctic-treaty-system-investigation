Recommendation XIII-13 (ATCM XIII - Brussels, 1985)

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREA No 7 : CAPE HALLETT, VICTORIA LAND : EXTENSION OF BOUNDARIES

The Representatives, 

Recalling Recommendation IV-7 in accordance with which an area between the eastern side of the road, which runs along the eastern side of Willett Cove, and the western margin of the permanent ice sheet, to the south of a line from the road to the margin to the permanent ice sheet at the latitude of the head of Willett Cove, and to the north of a line from the road to the margin of the permanent ice sheet drawn 350 metres to the south of that latitude and parallel to it, was designated for insertion in Annex B, Specially Protected Areas, of the Agreed Measures for the Protection of Antarctic Fauna and Flora on the grounds that Cape Hallett includes a small patch of particularly rich and diverse vegetation which supports a variety of terrestrial fauna and that the ecosystem, which includes a rich avifauna, is of outstanding scientific interest;

Considering that in recent years rich areas of vegetation have developed immediately outside of the existing boundaries of the area; that to the south is a particularly dense and extensive stand of moss below a large permanent snow patch on the talus slope below the north end of the ice-fall; that the main moss stand is 35 m across but plants are widely scattered on ridges and gulleys throughout the area; that to the north, rock outcrops and stable scree support extensive stands of dense lichen growth (expecially Xanthoria) and mosses, that algae (Prasiola) are also present, and that these are some of the richest stands of vegetation in Victoria Land;

Recommend to their Governments that the Description of Specially Protected Area no. 7, Cape Hallett, Victoria Land, inserted in Annex B, Specially Protected Areas, of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora be amended as follows:

DESCRIPTION:  The area comprising a roughly rectangular block lies south of the northern coast of Cape Hallett between the road, which runs along the eastern side of Willett Cove and the western margin of the permanent ice sheet and to the north of an E-W line from a projection of the line of the road southward to a point 200 m south of latitude 72Â°18'S to the margin of the permanent ice sheet.  The original area and the revised boundaries are shown on the attached map.
