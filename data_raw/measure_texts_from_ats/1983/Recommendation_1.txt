Recommendation XII-1 (ATCM XII - Canberra, 1983)

THE COLLECTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF ANTARCTIC METEOROLOGICAL DATA

The Representatives, 

Recalling Recommendation VI-3 and X-3; 

Noting Resolutions 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the WMO Executive Committee, Thirty Fourth Session June 1982 concerning meteorological observing networks, collection and transmission of meteorological data and meteorological data processing in Antarctica; 

Recognising 

 (1) the continuing importance of Antarctic meteorological data for support of operations within Antarctica and for weather forecasting and research, especially climate research in the rest of the world; 

 (2) the need to maintain a basic network of meteorological stations providing surface and upper-air synoptic data to meet in so far as possible the requirements of Consultative Parties and of the WMO World Weather Watch; 

 (3) the diminished value of meteorological data if it is not available to users within and outside the Antarctic in accordance with the WMO schedules for the receipt of raw and processed data;

 (4) the paucity of Antarctic meteorological surface and upper air data and the consequent importance of maintaining regularity of meteorological observations; and 

 (5) that the increasing shipping and aircraft activities in Antarctica will give rise to increasing demands for meteorological support; 

Reaffirming the importance of the WMO Global Telecommunications System (GTS) for purposes of transmitting Antarctic meteorological data between Antarctic stations in cases where direct transmission within Antarctica is inhibited by ionospheric conditions, and noting that the adoption by some Consultative Parties of satellite communications may facilitate the reception within Antarctica of meteorological data from the GTS; 

Noting: 

 (1) that monitoring carried out by WMO in 1982 and 1983 on the flow of Antarctic meteorological data into the GTS indicates that significant  deficiencies remain; 

 (2) the reactivation of the WMO Executive Committee Working Group on Antarctic Meteorology and the outcome of its Third Session in April 1982, including preliminary work on a review of the requirements for raw and processed data set out in Annexes 1 and 2 of Recommendation VI-3; 

 (3) the efforts of the WMO Meeting of Experts on Antarctic Data Telecommunication Arrangements in June 1983, in reviewing and updating the meteorological telecommunications routing diagrams set forth in Annexes 1, 2 and 3 of Recommendation X-3; and 

 (4) that the aforesaid WMO Meeting of Experts arrived at a number of conclusions and recommendations aimed at improving Antarctic telecommunications for meteorological purposes, and at improving the manner in which  Antarctic meteorological data is transmitted within the GTS of the WMO World Weather Watch; 

Recognising the need to keep under review: 

 (1) the requirements for raw and processed Antarctic meteorological data; and 

 (2) the arrangements for transmission of meteorological data within Antarctica and between Antarctica and the WMO World Weather Watch system; 

Recommend to their Governments that they: 
 
 (1) use their best endeavours, subject to any overriding scientific, administrative or budgetary considerations, to secure full implementation of the network of stations and observational programs set forth in Annex 1 of this Recommendation; 

 (2) maintain and improve, subject to any overriding scientific, administrative or budgetary considerations, the system for collection and distribution of meteorological data to, from and within Antarctica having regard to the routing arrangements shown in Annexes 2 and 3, which are based on the conclusions of the WMO Meeting of Experts on Antarctic Data Telecommunication Arrangements in June 1983; 

 (3) seek, through their Permanent Representatives with WMO, the completion of Annex IV to the Final Report of the aforesaid WMO Meeting of Experts, as a helpful contribution to planning the exchange of available meteorological data; 

 (4) seek, through their Permanent Representatives with WMO, to ensure that consideration is given, as appropriate, to other conclusions and recommendations made by the aforesaid WMO Meeting of Experts; 

 (5) invite WMO through their Permanent Representatives with that Organisation, to keep under review the arrangements for routing of meteorological data within Antarctica and between Antarctica and the GTS of the World Weather Watch, and to suggest actions which might be taken to improve the timely receipt of data at stations in Antarctica and at World Meteorological Centres Melbourne, Moscow and Washington and other centres in the World Weather Watch System, having particular regard to changing requirements for meteorological information and to opportunities offered by new technology; and 

 (6)  Note that the statements of requirements for raw and processed Antarctic meteorological data provided by the WMO pursuant to Recommendation X-3 paragraph 9 require refinement, and invite WMO, through their Permanent Representatives with that Organization, to undertake such refinement.
