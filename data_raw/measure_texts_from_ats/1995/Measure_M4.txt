Measure 4 (1995) - ATCM XIX, Seoul

ANTARCTIC PROTECTED AREA SYSTEM:
NEW HISTORIC SITES AND MONUMENTS

The Representatives of the Consultative Parties,

Recalling the Measures adopted in Recommendations l-IX, V-4, VI-14, VII-9, XII-7, XIII-16, and XIV-8;

Recommend to their Governments the following Measure for approval in accordance with paragraph 4 of Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty; that the following historic monuments be added to the "List of Historic Monuments Identified and Described by the Proposing Government or Governments" annexed to Recommendation VII-9.

-    Port Lockroy, Base A, on Goudier Island, off Wiencke Island, Antarctic Peninsula (Lat 64°49' S, Long 63°31' W).  Of historic importance as an Operation Tabarin base and for scientific research.

-    Argentine Islands, Base F (Wordie House), South-west corner of Winter Island, one of the group known as the Argentine Islands (Lat 65°15' S, Long 64°16' W).  Of historic interest as an example of an early British scientific base.

-    Horseshoe Island, Base Y, Marguerite Bay, West Graham Land (Lat 67°49' S, Long 67°18' W).  Noteworthy as a relatively unaltered and completely equipped base of a later period.  Blaiklock, the refuge hut nearby, is taken to be an integral part of the base.

-    Stonington Island, Base E, Northern end of Stonington Island, Marguerite Bay, West Graham Land (Long 68°11' S, 67°00' W).  Of historical importance in the early period of exploration and later British Antarctic Survey (BAS) history of the 1960s and 70s.

-    Message Post, Svend Foyn Island.  A pole with a box attached was placed on 16 January 1895 during the whaling expedition of Henryk Bull and Captain Leonard Kristensen of the ship "Antarctica."  It was examined and found intact by the British Antarctic Expedition of 1898-1900 and then sighted from the beach by the USS Edisto in 1956 and USCGS Glacier in 1965 (latitude approximately 71°52'S, longitude 171°10'E).

-    Prestrud's Cairn, at the foot of main bluff Scott Nunataks, Queen Alexandra Mountains.  A small rock cairn at the foot of the main bluff on the north side of the Aunataks by Lieutenant K. Prestrud on 3 December 1911 during the Norwegian Antarctic Expedition of 1910- 1912 (latitude 77°12' S, longitude 154°30' W).

-    Rock Shelter "Granite House", Cape Geology, Granite Harbour.  This shelter was constructed in December 1911 for use as a field kitchen by Taylor's second geological excursion during the British Antarctic Expedition of 1910-1913.  It was enclosed on three sides with granite boulder walls and used as a sledge to form a roof tree which supported seal skins anchored by heavy rocks (latitude 77°00'S, longitude 162°32'E).  A 1981 inspection of the "house" found it in good condition although the sledge had begun to disintegrate.  The most recent visit to the site in 1990 reported that this deterioration was accelerating.

-    Depot, Hells Gate Moraine, Inexpressible Island, Terra Nova Bay.  An emergency depot, consisting of a sledge loaded with supplies and equipment, was place on 25 January 1913 by the British Antarctic Expedition at the close of the 1910-1913 expedition.  The depot was established by the crew of the Terra Nova to provide security in the event the ship was unable to return and pick them up (latitude 74°56'S, longitude 163°48'E).  In 1994, the sledge and supplies were removed in order to stabilise their condition as wind and scoria particles had started to cause rapid deterioration.

-    Message Post, Cape Crozier.  Erected on 22 January 1902 by Captain Robert F Scott's Discovery Expedition (the National Antarctic Expedition of 1901-1904) and consists of a post to which a metal cylinder was attached containing an account of the Expedition's movements.  It was intended to provide information for the expedition relief ships (latitude 77°27'S, longitude 169°16'E).  The message post, although weathered, still stands, its grain blasted into high relief by countless storms.  The record cylinder no longer exists.

-    Message Post, Cape Wadsworth, Coulman Island.  A metal cylinder nailed to a red pole 8 meters above sea level placed by Captain R. F. Scott on 15 January 1902.  He also painted the rocks behind the post red and white to make it more conspicuous (latitude 73°19'S, longitude 169°47'E).

-    Whalers Bay Whaling Station, Whalers Bay, Deception Island.  Established in 1906 by Captain Adolfo Andresen.  Of historical importance as an example of an Antarctic whaling station.
