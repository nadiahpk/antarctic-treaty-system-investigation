Recommendation XVI-9 (ATCM XVI - Bonn, 1991)

ANTARCTIC PROTECTED AREA SYSTEM
SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREA NO. 23
FORLIDAS POND AND DAVIS VALLEY PONDS

The Representatives,

Recalling Recommendations XV-8 and XV-9;

Noting that a Management Plan has been prepared and approved by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR);

Considering that the Area contains some of the most southerly freshwater ponds known in Antarctica containing plant life, and that these ponds and their immediate catchments should be protected as examples of unique near-pristine ecosystems which should be afforded maximum protection from human influence;

Recommend to their Governments that the following Area of outstanding scientific interest be inserted in Annex B, Specially Protected Areas, of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora, together with the annexed Management Plan:

Specially Protected Area No. 23

Forlidas Pond and Davis Valley Ponds, situated near the east end of the Dufek Massif at position 82°27'15"S, 51°21'W. The Area includes smaller ponds that occur along the ice margin at the northern edge of Davis Valley, a short distance east of Forlidas Pond.
