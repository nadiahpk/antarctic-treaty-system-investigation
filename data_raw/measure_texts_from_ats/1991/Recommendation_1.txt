Recommendation XVI-1 (ATCM XVI - Bonn, 1991)

EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION

The Representatives,

Recalling the provisions of Articles III and VII of the Antarctic Treaty;

Noting that their Governments give effect in their domestic legislation to obligations arising from agreements reached at Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings;

Noting that the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals, the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources and the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty contain provisions whereby information about such domestic legislation is, or is to be, exchanged between Parties;

Noting, however, that such provision has not been made in relation to obligations arising from Recommendations adopted at Consultative Meetings;

Aware that knowledge of this domestic legislation can be of interest to the other Consultative Parties; 

Recommend to their Governments that they include in their exchange of information under Article VII (5) of the Antarctic Treaty, information on any domestic legislation enacted to give effect to the Antarctic Treaty and to obligations arising from Recommendations adopted at Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings.
