The Representatives,

Recalling Recommendation XV-8 and XV-9;

Noting that a Management Plan has been approved by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR);

Considering that Avian Island, together with its littoral zone is unique in the Antarctic Peninsula region for its abundance and diversity of breeding seabirds, including Adélie Penguins, Blue-eyed Shags, Giant Petrels, Dominican Gulls, South Polar Skuas and Wilson's Petrels, and that the colony of Adélie Penguins is the largest on the Antarctic Peninsula, and that other species are at or near the southern limits of their breeding range, and that the island is vulnerable to visits by tourists, and uncontrolled personnel;

Recommend to their Governments that:

 (i) the designation of Avian Island as Site of Special Scientific Interest No. 30 under Recommendations VIII-3 and VIII-4 be terminated;

 (ii) the number 30 should not be used for another Site of Special Scientific Interest;

 (iii) the following area of outstanding ornithological interest be inserted in Annex B, Specially Protected Areas, of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora (1964), along with the Management Plan accompanying the description of the said Specially Protected Area: 

Specially Protected Area No. 21
