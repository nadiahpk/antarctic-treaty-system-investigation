Recommendation XVI-11 (ATCM XVI - Bonn, 1991)

ANTARCTIC PROTECTED AREA SYSTEM
NEW HISTORIC SITES AND MONUMENTS

The Representatives,

Recalling Recommendations I-IX, V-4, VI-14, VII-9, XII-7, XIII-16 and XIV-8;

Recommend to their Governments that the following historic sites (monuments) be added to the "List of Historic Monuments Identified and Described by the Proposing Government or Governments" annexed to Recommendation VII-9 and that thereafter they be accorded the respect and protection required by the Recommendations recalled above:

56.  Waterboat Point, Danco Coast, Antarctic Peninsula (64°49'S, 62°52'W).  The remains and immediate environs of the Waterboat Point hut, situated close to the unoccupied Chilean station, ‘President Gabriel González Videla’.  The Waterboat Point hut, of which only the base of the boat, roots of door posts and an outline of the hut and extension still exist, was occupied by the UK two-man expedition of Bagshawe and Lester in 1921-22.  This was, and indeed remains, the smallest expedition ever to overwinter in Antarctica.

57.  Commemorative plaque at Yankee Bay, MacFarlane Strait, Greenwich Island, South Shetland Islands, near the Chilean refuge located at latitude 62°32'S and longitude 59°45'W, to the memory of Captain Robert MacFarlane, who in 1820 explored the Antarctic Peninsula Area in the brigantine Dragón.

58.  Cairn with memorial plaque erected at Whalers’ Bay, Deception Island, South Shetland Islands, in the vicinity of the whalers' cemetery (Historic Monument No. 31) 62°59'S, 60°34'W, to honour Captain Adolfus Amandus Andresen, Antarctic pioneer, who was first to establish a whaling operation at Deception Island in 1906.

59.  A cairn on Half Moon beach, Cape Shirreff, Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands, commemorating the officers, soldiers and seamen on board the San Telmo, which sank in September 1819; possibly the first people to live and die in the wastes of Antarctica.
