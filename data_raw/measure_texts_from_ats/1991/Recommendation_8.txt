Recommendation XVI-8 (ATCM XVI - Bonn, 1991)

ANTARCTIC PROTECTED AREA SYSTEM
SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREA NO. 22
CRYPTOGAM RIDGE; MOUNT MELBOURNE, VICTORIA LAND

The Representatives,

Recalling Recommendations XV-8 and XV-9;

Noting that a Management Plan has been prepared and approved by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR);

Considering that Cryptogam Ridge on the southern rim of the main summit crater of Mount Melbourne includes areas of geothermal activity which are ice-free and surrounded by numerous ice hummocks and scattered ice towers, and that the geothermal ground supports a unique community of bryophytes, algae and microbiota including very rare species, and that this fragile habitat is of exceptional biological interest and, to maintain its unique pristine state, should be afforded maximum protection from human influence;

Recommend to their Governments that the following area of outstanding scientific interest be inserted in Annex B, Specially Protected Areas, of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora, together with the annexed Management Plan:

Specially Protected Area No. 22

Cryptogam Ridge, Mount Melbourne, Victoria Land. Mount Melbourne (74°21'S, 164°42'E) lies between Wood Bay and Campbell Glacier, northern Victoria Land, on the western side of the Ross Sea.
