Recommendation VI-5 (ATCM VI - Tokyo, 1970)

THE USE OF RADIO-ISOTOPES IN THE ANTARCTIC

The Representatives, 

Recognizing;

(1) the need to minimise harmful disturbance to the Antarctic environment; 

(2) that the uncontrolled use of radio-isotopes in the course of scientific investigations may jeopardise the conduct of subsequent investigations; 

Recommend to their Governments that through their National Antarctic Committees, they invite the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research to consider the uses of radio-isotopes in Antarctic scientific investigations and to propose comprehensive principles for their control which can be considered under Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty.
