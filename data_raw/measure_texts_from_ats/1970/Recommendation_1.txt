Recommendation VI-1 (ATCM VI - Tokyo, 1970)

ANTARCTIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS

The Representatives,

Considering that:

(1) an Antarctic telecommunications system serves the administrative, operational, meteorological and other scientific needs of stations in the Antarctic;

(2) there is a need to exchange meteorological information as soon as possible within the Antarctic Treaty area and to transmit that information with minimum delay to the Global Telecommunications System;

(3) there is a need to organize technically compatible routes for telecommunications both within, and out of the Antarctic Treaty area;

(4) an Antarctic telecommunications system needs to respond, as may be appropriate, to future changes in requirements for transmission of meteorological information and advances in telecommunications technology;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1.  They adopt as guide-lines the Proposals contained in the Final Report of the Second Antarctic Treaty Meeting on Telecommunications held in Buenos Aires in 1969;

2.  In the plans for their expeditions they provide the organizational and technical arrangements necessary to implement these Proposals as soon as, and as far as practicable.
