ANTARCTIC METEOROLOGY

The Representatives,
  
Considering that:

 (1) the exchange of scientific observations is provided by paragraph 1(c) of Article III of the Antarctic Treaty;

 (2) meteorological information for flight, marine and field operational forecasts is an important requirement at some stations in the Antarctic;

 (3) Antarctic meteorological information is required by adjacent continents for the preparation of weather analyses and prognoses;

 (4) meteorological activities in the Antarctic should be supported, to the greatest extent feasible, by transmissions of processed data to the Antarctic from the World Weather Watch;

 (5) the requirements of the Consultative Parties for meteorological information will change as the operational activities and the scientific programmes of their Antarctic stations evolve;

 (6) the requirements of the Consultative Parties for meteorological information will change as knowledge and understanding of the meteorology of the Antarctic Treaty area grow and with developments in meteorological technology;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. They adopt Annex 1 to this Recommendation as a current basis for planning the exchange of available raw meteorological data;

2. They adopt Annex 2 to this Recommendation as a current basis for planning the exchange of available processed meteorological data;

3. They support, as far as practicable, such measures as will facilitate the speedy and effective implementation of Annexes 1 and 2 as a basis for planning;

4. They invite the World Meteorological Organization to review Annexes 1 and 2 from time to time and advise them of the results of such reviews.
