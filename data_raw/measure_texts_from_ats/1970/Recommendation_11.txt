Recommendation VI-11 (ATCM VI - Tokyo, 1970)

NEW ISLANDS

The Representatives,

Recognizing the special scientific interest of new islands formed by geological processes in the Antarctic;

Recalling that the investigation of the colonization of an uncontaminated area by animals and plants can easily be spoiled by the presence of man;

Recommend to their Governments:

1.  That any new island formed by geological processes in the Antarctic Treaty area should be the subject of immediate consultation through diplomatic channels with a view to its consideration at the next Consultative Meeting in order to accord it special protection.  Until this can be done, they should use their best endeavors to avoid its contamination by human interference;

2.  That they should use their best endeavors to prevent tourists from landing on such islands.
