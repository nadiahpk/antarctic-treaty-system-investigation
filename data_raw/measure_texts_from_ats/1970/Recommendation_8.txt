PERMITS FOR ENTRY TO SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS

The Representatives, 

Recalling Article VIII of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora annexed to Recommendation III-VIII ("the Agreed Measures") and the need to conform with paragraph 4(a) of that Article; 

Considering that, in order to be effective, the existing prohibitions and measures of protection relating to Specially Protected Areas need to be strengthened; 

Recommend to their Governments that: 

1.  They use their best endeavours to ensure compliance with those provisions of the Agreed Measures which relate to Specially Protected Areas; 

2.  They take such action as may be appropriate to prohibit the entry by their nationals into a Specially Protected Area, except in accordance with a permit issued under Articles VI and VIII of the Agreed Measures;   

3.  Until such time as this Recommendation may become effective in accordance with Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty, it shall, as far as feasible, be considered as a guide-line.
