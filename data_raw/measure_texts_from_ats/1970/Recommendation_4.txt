Recommendation VI-4 (ATCM VI - Tokyo, 1970)

MAN'S IMPACT ON THE ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT

The Representatives, 

Considering and Recognizing that:

(1) in the Antarctic Treaty area the ecosystem is particularly vulnerable to  human interference;

(2) the Antarctic derives much of its scientific importance from its uncontaminated and undisturbed condition;

(3) there is an increasingly urgent need to protect the environment from human interference;

(4) the Consultative Parties should assume responsibility for the protection of the environment and the wise use of the Treaty area;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. They invite the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research through their National Antarctic Committees:

    (a) to identify the types and assess the extent of human interference which has occurred in the Treaty area as a result of manâ€™s activities;
    (b) to propose measures which might be taken to minimize harmful interference;
    (c) to consider and recommend scientific programmes which will detect and measure changes occurring in the Antarctic environment;

2.  They encourage research on the impact of man on the Antarctic ecosystem;

3.  They take interim measures to reduce known causes of harmful environmental interference;

4.  They consider including on the agenda for the Seventh Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting an examination of this matter in the light of any further available information.
