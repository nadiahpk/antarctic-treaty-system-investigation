Recommendation VI-12 (ATCM VI - Tokyo, 1970)

SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ROCKETS*

The Representatives, 
  
Considering that: 

(1) in recent years a number of countries have launched scientific research rockets (sounding rockets) from the Antarctic Treaty area and that the number of such launchings is expected to increase along with the scale and importance of scientific research activities in the Antarctic; 

(2) it will be necessary to adopt adequate safety measures to prevent possible damage or injury to persons, fauna and flora, facilities, vessels and aircraft in the Antarctic Treaty area and in adjacent areas which might result from the launching of rockets from the Treaty area or from their residual elements; 
  
Recommend to their Governments that: 

1. Each Government which plans to launch rockets from the Antarctic Treaty area include in its annual exchange of information under paragraph 5 of Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty details of each planned launching, including inter alia the following information: 

    (a) the geographical co-ordinates of the place of launching;
    (b) the time and date of launching or, alternatively, the approximate period of time during which it is planned to carry out the launchings;
    (c) the direction of launching;
    (d) the planned maximum altitude;
    (e) the planned impact area;
    (f)  the type and other specifications of the rockets to be launched, including possible residual hazards;
    (g) the purpose and research programme of the rocket,

2. During summer operations, and at other times when there are operations in its area, each station use its radio facilities to keep neighbouring stations informed, on a daily basis as appropriate, of its launching schedules.
