Recommendation VI-7 (ATCM VI - Tokyo, 1970)

EFFECTS OF TOURISTS AND NON-GOVERNMENT EXPEDITIONS TO THE ANTARCTIC TREATY AREA

The Representatives,  

Noting the increase in recent years in the number of tourists and also in the number of visitors who are not sponsored by the Consultative Parties to the Antarctic Treaty area; 

Considering that the activities of such visitors can have lasting and harmful effects on scientific programmes, on the Antarctic environment, particularly in Specially Protected Areas, and on historic monuments; 

Desiring to ensure that such visitors are afforded the best view of stations in the Antarctic compatible with the research programmes being undertaken; 

Recalling paragraph 5 of Article VII and Article X of the Antarctic Treaty and Recommendations I-VI and IV-27; 

Recommend to their Governments that:

1.  They should exert appropriate efforts to ensure that all tourists and other visitors do not engage in any activity in the Treaty area which is contrary to the principles and purposes of the Antarctic Treaty or Recommendations made under it; 

2.  They should inform, in so far as they are able, those responsible for expeditions to the Treaty area which are not organized by a Consultative Party but organized in, proceeding from, or calling at, their territory, of the following: 

 (a) that final arrangements to visit any station be made with that station between twenty four and seventy two hours in advance of the expected time of arrival;

 (b) that all tourists and other visitors comply with any conditions or   restrictions on their movements which the station commander may stipulate for their safety or to safeguard scientific programmes being undertaken at or near the station; 

 (c) that visitors must not enter Specially Protected Areas and must respect designated historic monuments; 

3.  Advance notice of all expeditions to the Treaty area not organized by a Consultative Party, but organized in, proceeding from or calling at that Partyâ€™s territory, shall be given, in so far as is possible, to the other Consultative Parties.  Such notice shall include the relevant information listed in Recommendation I-VI; 

4.  Until such time as this Recommendation becomes effective in accordance with Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty, it shall be considered, as far as feasible, as a guide-line.
