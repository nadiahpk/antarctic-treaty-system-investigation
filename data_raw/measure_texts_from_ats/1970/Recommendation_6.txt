Recommendation VI-6 (ATCM VI - Tokyo, 1970)

COORDINATION OF ANTARCTIC SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING THE USE OF RADIO-ISOTOPES

The Representatives, 

Recognizing that experiments involving the use of radio-isotopes may jeopardize subsequent scientific investigations in the same locality; 

Considering that: 

(1)  prior notification of the use of radio-isotopes is necessary to allow time for consultations between Consultative Parties whose investigators may wish to carry out experiments in the same locality at a later date; 

(2)  interim measures are required before agreement is reached on the controlled use of radio-isotopes in the Antarctic Treaty area; 

Recommend to their Governments that, when experiments involving the use of radio-isotopes in the Antarctic Treaty area are planned, they should provide appropriate information on such experiments to other Consultative Parties as early as possible, preferably six months in advance, but in any event annually.
