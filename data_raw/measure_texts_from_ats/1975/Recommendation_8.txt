ACTIVITIES OF STATES THAT ARE NOT CONSULTATIVE PARTIES

The Representatives, 

Recalling the principles and purposes of the Antarctic Treaty; 

Reaffirming that it is in the interest of all mankind that Antarctica shall continue forever to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and shall not become the scene or object of international discord; 

Recognizing that the Antarctic Treaty places a special responsibility on the Contracting Parties to exert appropriate efforts, consistent with the Charter of the United Nations, to the end that no one engages in any activity in the Antarctic Treaty Area contrary to the principles or purposes of the Treaty; 

Considering paragraphs 15 to 17 of the Final Report of the Seventh Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting regarding activities in the Treaty Area by States that are not Contracting Parties; 

Considering further that it is desirable for acceding States to approve existing and future Recommendations, which form an integral part of the Treaty regime; 

Recommend to their Governments that: 

1. They reaffirm the principles set forth in paragraphs 15 to 17 of the Final Report of the Seventh Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in respect of activities by States that are not Contracting Parties to the Antarctic Treaty; 

2. They urge the States that have or will become Parties to the Antarctic Treaty to approve the Recommendations adopted at Consultative Meetings in pursuance of the Treaty and subsequently approved by all the Contracting Parties whose representatives were entitled to participate in the meetings held to consider those measures.
