The Representatives, 

Recalling Recommendations VI-4 and VII-1; 

Desiring to minimise the impact of man on the Antarctic environment; 

Noting with appreciation the response of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) to Recommendation VI-4; 

Recommend to their Governments that: 

1. To the greatest extent feasible they observe the code of conduct annexed to this Recommendation at their stations and for their activities within the Antarctic Treaty Area; 

2. Through their National Antarctic Committees they invite SCAR, in co-operation with the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE) of the International Council of Scientific Unions, to continue its interest in the development of scientific programmes for detecting and assessing changes occurring in the Antarctic environment.
