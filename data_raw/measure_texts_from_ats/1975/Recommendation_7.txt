Recommendation VIII-7 (ATCM VIII - Oslo, 1975)

CO-OPERATION IN TRANSPORT

The Representatives, 

Recalling Recommendation VII-8; 

Recognizing that access to Antarctica by long-range aircraft combined with intracontinental feeder routes by smaller aircraft would facilitate new levels of co-operation and flexibility in research; 

Noting the interest taken by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) in the potential benefits to be derived from a co-operative air transport system; 

Recommend to their Governments that:   

1. They request their offices responsible for the administration of Antarctic expeditions to review their scientific programmes in order to identify the ways in which a co-operative air transport system might benefit them and to inform SCAR through their representatives on the SCAR Working Group on Logistics; 

2. They request SCAR, through their National Antarctic Committees, to review the available transport resources and the potential requirements with respect to a co-operative air transport system and to bring their conclusions to the attention of the Consultative Parties.
