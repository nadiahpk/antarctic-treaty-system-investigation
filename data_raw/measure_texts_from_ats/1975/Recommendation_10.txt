Recommendation VIII-10 (ATCM VIII - Oslo, 1975)

ANTARCTIC MARINE LIVING RESOURCES

The Representatives, 

Recalling Article IX, paragraph 1(f), of the Antarctic Treaty; 

Convinced that the Antarctic Treaty Area contains significant concentrations of marine living resources; 

Recognizing the need to promote and achieve, within the framework of the Antarctic Treaty, the objectives of protection, scientific study and rational use of these marine living resources; 

Aware of the inadequacy of the information concerning the stocks of these living resources and of the need to develop a good scientific foundation for appropriate conservation measures; 

Recommend to their Governments that: 

1.  They initiate or expand, insofar as is practicable within their Antarctic scientific programmes, detailed studies of the biology, distribution, bio-mass and population dynamics and the ecology of Antarctic marine living resources; 

2.  They encourage further co-operation among the Consultative Parties in scientific studies of and programmes relating to Antarctic marine living resources; 

3.  They encourage studies which could lead to the development of effective measures for the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources in the Treaty Area; 

4.  They urge the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), through their National Antarctic Committees, to continue its scientific work on these matters and to consider convening, as soon as practicable, a meeting to discuss current work and report on programmes for the study and conservation of Antarctic marine living resources; 

5.  They include the subject "Antarctic Marine Living Resources" on the agenda of the Ninth Consultative Meeting.
