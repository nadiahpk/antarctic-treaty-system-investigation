Recommendation VIII-3 (ATCM VIII - Oslo, 1975)

SITES OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST

The Representatives, 

Recalling Article II of the Antarctic Treaty and Recommendation VII-3; 

Conscious of the need to protect scientific investigations which might suffer from wilful or accidental interference;

Desiring to protect only sites where harmful interference is generally recognised to be likely; 

Recognizing the need to protect such scientific investigations irrespective of their purpose; 

Recognizing that a limited number of sites of exceptional scientific interest may require long-term protection from harmful interference; 

Noting with appreciation the interim response of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) to paragraph 1 of Recommendation VII-3; 

Recommend to their Governments that: 

1.  They invite SCAR, through their National Committees, to have regard to the following when considering proposals for Sites of Special Scientific Interest:
 
  (a) Sites should only be proposed when: 
       (i) Scientific investigations are being carried out or are planned to begin before the following meeting of SCAR, and there is a demonstrable risk of           interference which would jeopardise those scientific investigations; or 
       (ii) they are of exceptional scientific interest and therefore require long-term protection from harmful interference; 
 
   (b) Sites should be proposed for designation up to a specified date, which may be extended following a review by SCAR; 

   (c) Proposals for the designation of Sites should be accompanied by a management plan which should include, inter alia, and where applicable, the following details: 
        (i) a description of the Site, together with a map delimiting its boundaries and where applicable showing any existing or proposed demarcations on the Site; 
       (ii) a statement setting out the reasons in conformity with paragraphs 1(a) (i) and (ii) above for designation of the Site; 
       (iii) a summary of the scientific investigations being carried out or planned; 
       (iv) the proposed date at which the designation will expire unless extended; 
       (v) proposed points of access; 
       (vi) any proposed pedestrian and vehicular routes; 
       (vii) other kinds of scientific investigation which would not cause harmful interference with the investigations described at paragraph (c)(iii) above; 
       (viii) whether specific kinds of scientific sampling may take place and guidelines for such sampling; 
       (ix) any other restraints that may be needed. 

2.  They invite SCAR, through their National Committees, to initiate review of those Sites whose designation is likely to terminate before the second following Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting; 

3.  They request their national offices responsible for the administration of Antarctic expeditions to maintain a record of activities within each Site of Special Scientific Interest in which their scientists are active; 

4.  Persons wishing to visit Sites of Special Scientific Interest should consult their national offices responsible for the administration of Antarctic expeditions.

5.  Until such time as the Recommendations designating Sites of Special Scientific Interest become effective in accordance with Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty, they should, as far as possible, be considered as guidelines.
