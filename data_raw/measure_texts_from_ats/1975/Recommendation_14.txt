Recommendation VIII-14 (ATCM VIII - Oslo, 1975)

ANTARCTIC RESOURCES - EFFECTS OF MINERAL EXPLORATION

The Representatives, 

Recalling Recommendation VII-6; 

Bearing in mind the purposes and principles of the Antarctic Treaty; 

Reaffirming that it is in the interest of all mankind that the Antarctic Treaty Area shall continue forever to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and shall not become the scene or object of international discord; 

Acknowledging that the Antarctic Treaty places a special responsibility upon the Contracting Parties to exert appropriate efforts, consistent with the Charter of the United Nations, to ensure that no one engages in any activity in the Antarctic Treaty Area contrary to the purposes or principles of the Treaty; 

Concerned that mineral resource exploration and exploitation could adversely affect the unique environment of the Antarctic and of other ecosystems dependent on the Antarctic environment; 

Noting the technological developments in polar mineral exploration and exploitation; 

Convinced that further consultations on the questions concerning Antarctic mineral resources are desirable and, in the meantime, of the need for restraint while seeking timely agreed solutions by the Consultative Parties to problems raised by such questions; and noting the intention of their Governments to keep these matters under review in the light of possible actions by others; 

Aware that available scientific information on the environmental effects of mineral exploration and/or exploitation in the Antarctic has been inadequately studied and that the Consultative Parties bear a special responsibility for environmental protection in the Antarctic Treaty Area; 

Aware also that Antarctic geological structures have not been sufficiently investigated; 

Recognizing the need for further study and consideration of these matters; 

Resolved that the Consultative Parties should seek to develop an approach to the problems raised by the possible presence of valuable mineral resources in the Antarctic Treaty Area, bearing in mind the principles and purposes of the Antarctic Treaty; 

Recommend to their Governments that: 

1.  The subject "Antarctic Resources - The Question of Mineral Exploration and Exploitation" be fully studied in all its aspects in relation to the Treaty and be the subject of consultation among them with a view to convening a special preparatory meeting during 1976, the terms of reference of which will be determined precisely through diplomatic channels; the special preparatory meeting to report to the Ninth Consultative Meeting; 

2.  They undertake to study the environmental implications of mineral resource activities in the Antarctic Treaty Area and other related matters, including joint studies among them, and that they exchange the results of such studies; 

3.  They invite SCAR through their National Antarctic Committees to: 

(i)  make an assessment on the basis of available information of the possible impact on the environment of the Treaty Area and other ecosystems dependent on the Antarctic environment if mineral exploration and/or exploitation were to occur there.  If possible and appropriate, Governments may wish to assist their National Antarctic Committees in this undertaking by appropriate means; 

(ii) continue to co-ordinate national geological and geophysical research programmes in the Antarctic Treaty Area with the aim of obtaining fundamental scientific data on the geological structure of the Antarctic; 

(iii) consider what further scientific programmes are necessary in pursuit of these objectives; 

4.  The subject "Antarctic Resources - The Question of Mineral Exploration and Exploitation" be placed on the Agenda of the Ninth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.
