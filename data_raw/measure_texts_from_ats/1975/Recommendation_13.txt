Recommendation VIII-13 (ATCM VIII - Oslo, 1975)

THE ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT

The Representatives, 

Recognizing that prime responsibility for Antarctic matters, including protection of the Antarctic environment, lies with the States active in the area which are parties to the Antarctic Treaty; 

Noting the vulnerability of the Antarctic environment to human interference and that the consequences of major alterations would be of global significance;

Noting the distance of the Antarctic from the main sources of environmental pollution and hence its value for global baseline monitoring purposes; 

Considering the role of the Antarctic as a global climatic regulator of major importance; 

Noting that in seeking to fulfil these responsibilities Antarctic Treaty States have;

 (a) negotiated the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and  Flora;

 (b) negotiated the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (London 1972);

 (c) invited the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) of the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU): 

      (i)  to identify the types and assess the extent of human interference which has occurred in the Treaty Area as a result of man’s activities; 
      (ii)  to propose measures which might be taken to minimise harmful interference; 
      (iii) to consider and recommend scientific programmes which will detect and measure changes occurring in the Antarctic environment; 

Noting that a Code of Conduct for stations and activities within the Antarctic Treaty Area to minimise their harmful environmental effects has been adopted; 

Noting that the Antarctic Treaty calls upon Contracting Parties to encourage co-operative working relations with those specialized agencies of the United Nations and other international organizations having a scientific or technical interest in the Antarctic; 

Noting the cable to the Chairman of the Consultative Meeting from the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), circulated to the meeting on 10 June 1975; 

Recommend to their Governments that: 

1. In exercising their responsibility for the wise use and protection of the Antarctic environment they shall have regard to the following: 

 (a) that in considering measures for the wise use and protection of the Antarctic environment they shall act in accordance with their responsibility for ensuring that such measures are consistent with the interests of all mankind;

 (b) that no act or activity having an inherent tendency to modify the environment over wide areas within the Antarctic Treaty Area should be undertaken unless appropriate steps have been taken to foresee the probable modifications and to exercise appropriate controls with respect to the harmful environmental effects such uses of the Antarctic Treaty Area may have;

 (c) that in co-operation with SCAR and other relevant agencies they continue, within the capabilities of their Antarctic scientific programmes, to monitor changes in the environment, irrespective of their cause, and to exercise their responsibility for informing the world community of any significant changes caused by man’s activities outside the Antarctic Treaty Area; 

2. They welcome the offer made by UNEP of co-operation in questions of scientific and technical interest relating to the Antarctic environment and invite SCAR, through their National Antarctic Committees, to continue its participation in the development of the relevant parts of the programme under consideration by the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE).
