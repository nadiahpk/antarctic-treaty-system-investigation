Recommendation VIII-6 (ATCM VIII - Oslo, 1975)

ANNUAL EXCHANGES OF INFORMATION

The Representatives, 

Recalling Articles III and VII of the Antarctic Treaty; 

Noting that numerous recommendations of Consultative Meetings have established requirements for exchange of information between Governments; 

Desiring to consolidate the requirements for periodic exchanges of information into a standard annual report; 

Conscious that other Recommendations, including Recommendations I-I, I- III, I-VII, I-XIII, II-I, II-VIII, IV-27, VI-3, VI-7, and VII-7 provide for exchanges of information on an occasional basis or outside the annual reports exchanged between Governments; 

Recommend to their Governments that: 

1. They adopt the Annex to this Recommendation as the standard format for the annual exchanges of information between Governments; 

2. They consider that the provisions set forth in the Annex satisfy the requirements for exchanges of information in Recommendations I-VI, II-IV, II-VI, III-I, III-II, IV-23, VI-2, VI-6, VI-12, and VI-13; 

3. They exchange the report described in the Annex through diplomatic channels, not later than 30 November each year; 

4. They report prior to 30 June in accordance with Recommendation II-VI on extensions, reductions or other modifications in the development of the activities previously reported; 

5. Until such time as the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora become effective, the information exchange requirements set forth in Recommendation IV-19 should be considered as an interim guideline and may be added to the Annex.
