Recommendation VIII-5 (ATCM VIII - Oslo, 1975)

PERMITS FOR ENTRY TO SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS

The Representatives, 

Noting that Recommendation VI-8, paragraph 2, and Articles VI and VIII of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora enable Governments to issue permits for entry to Specially Protected Areas only for the collection of native mammals or birds (Article VI) or native plants (Article VIII, paragraph 2 (a)); 

Desiring to extend this facility to include other compelling scientific purposes; 

Recommend to their Governments that: 

1.  Recommendation VI-8 be terminated; 

2.  The Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora be modified by the addition of a new subparagraph to Article VIII, paragraph 2, as follows: 

"(c) entry by their nationals, except in accordance with a permit issued under Article VI or under paragraph 2(a) of the present Article or in accordance with a permit issued for some other compelling scientific purpose."; 

3. Until such time as the Agreed Measures and this Recommendation become effective in accordance with Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty, this Recommendation should, as far as possible, be considered as a guideline.
