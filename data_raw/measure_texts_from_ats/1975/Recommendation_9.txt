Recommendation VIII-9 (ATCM VIII - Oslo, 1975)

EFFECTS OF TOURISTS AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL EXPEDITIONS IN THE ANTARCTIC TREATY AREA

The Representatives, 

Recognizing that tourists and other persons not sponsored by Consultative Parties are visiting the Antarctic Treaty Area in increasing numbers; 

Acknowledging that tourism is a natural development in this Area and that it requires regulation; 

Recalling Recommendation VII-4, and particularly the need to avoid increasing interference with natural ecological systems which are not yet sufficiently understood; 

Recognizing the necessity to restrict the number of places where large numbers of tourists may land so that the ecological effects may be monitored; 

Recommend to their Governments that: 

1.  They use their best endeavours to ensure that all those who enter the Antarctic Treaty Area, both those sponsored by Governments and those not so sponsored, are aware of the Statement of Accepted Practices and the Relevant Provisions of the Antarctic Treaty in Annex A to this Recommendation; 

2.  They request all organizers of tourist groups, except in an emergency, to: 

 (a) visit only those Antarctic stations for which permission has been sought and granted in accordance with Recommendation IV-27; 
 (b) land only within the Areas of Special Tourist Interest listed or defined in Annex B to this Recommendation; 

3.  When granting permission for tourist groups to visit Antarctic stations which they maintain, Consultative Parties shall require tour organizers to report their activities within the Treaty Area.  These reports shall be made at the end of the season to the Consultative Parties whose stations they have visited, in accordance with the requirements listed in Annex C to this Recommendation.  The Consultative Parties shall transmit any such reports received by them to the next Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting; 

4.  They keep Annexes A, B and C to this Recommendation under review at successive Consultative Meetings.
