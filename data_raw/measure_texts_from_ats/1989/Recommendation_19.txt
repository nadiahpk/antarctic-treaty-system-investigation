Recommendation XV-19 (ATCM XV - Paris, 1989)

COOPERATION IN THE HYDROGRAPHIC CHARTING OF ANTARCTIC WATERS

The Representatives,

Recognising the importance and historical values of activities carried out by the countries who developed the present knowledge of Antarctic hydrography;

Aware that there have been significant increases in both the number and size of vessels operating in Antarctic waters in recent years;

Recognising that severe environmental conditions in the Antarctic give rise to particular risks for shipping and hydrographic activities;

Recognising that the sea ice conditions can lead to the diversion of shipping from acknowledged routes, thus requiring the extension of charting into waters contiguous to such routes;

Conscious that the safety of life at sea and the protection of the Antarctic marine environment and dependent and associated ecosystems requires that the Consultative Parties should take all possible steps open to them, by improving the charting of Antarctic waters, to ensure the safety of navigation so that maritime accidents are reduced to a minimum;

Recognising that the resources available to devote to hydrographic surveys and the accurate positioning and depiction of the Antarctic coastline are scarce;

Conscious of the benefits to be gained by making provision for international cooperation between those countries which undertake hydrographic surveys and nautical charting of Antarctic waters and of utilising to the maximum extent cooperative arrangements which already exist routinely between hydrographic offices and, therefore, of the need to avoid the establishment of a parallel system;

Aware of the role traditionally played by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) in contributing to cooperation between hydrographic offices, and by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) in all cartographic and other scientific activities in Antarctica;

Recommend to their Governments that :

1.  They increase their mutual cooperation in the hydrographic survey and charting of Antarctic waters in order to contribute to the safety of navigation, the protection of the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems, and for scientific purposes.
2.  For the purposes of hydrographic survey and charting and associated terrestrial surveys and mapping, they coordinate their activities within the framework of IHO and SCAR, as appropriate.
