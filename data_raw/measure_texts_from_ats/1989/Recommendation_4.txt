Recommendation XV-4 (ATCM XV - Paris, 1989)

HUMAN IMPACT ON THE ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT: PREVENTION, CONTROL,  AND RESPONSE TO MARINE POLLUTION

The Representatives,

Recalling Recommendations IX-6 and X-7 on oil contamination of the Antarctic marine environment;

Recognizing the special characteristics of the Antarctic Treaty area and the particularly hazardous nature of the area for vessel operations;

Recognizing further that the Antarctic derives much of its scientific importance from its uncontaminated condition;

Reaffirming their commitment to the avoidance and reduction of the contamination of the sea by oil and other pollutants;

Noting the framework provided by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in its Part XII and other relevant international agreements for the protection and preservation of the marine environment;

Bearing in mind the need to take measures relating to the design, construction, manning, and equipment of vessels engaged in or supporting Antarctic operations to avoid marine pollution from vessels;

Recognizing further the importance of the expeditious exchange of information on weather and ice conditions in the Antarctic Treaty area and with respect to accidents and emergency response efforts;
Mindful of the need for accurate and up-to-date charting of the Antarctic Treaty area; and

Acknowledging the value of cooperation directly and through appropriate international organizations in efforts to avoid and respond to marine pollution incidents;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1 They approve and take measures within their competence necessary to ensure compliance with:
 (a) a prohibition within the Antarctic Treaty area on all intentional discharges, including oil, from vessels into the marine environment;
 (b) a prohibition within the Antarctic Treaty area on disposal from vessels into the marine environment of all plastics and garbage other than food wastes, provided that disposal of food wastes should be made as far as practicable from land, but in no event within 12 nautical miles of land or ice shelves; and
 (c) a prohibition within the Antarctic Treaty area on discharge of sewage from vessels within 12 nautical miles of land or ice shelves.
In implementing these provisions, they give due consideration to the need to avoid detrimental effects on dependent or associated ecosystems outside the Antarctic Treaty area.

2. They take measures within their competence necessary to ensure compliance by all their vessels engaged in or supporting Antarctic operations with the relevant provisions of the following conventions:
 (a) the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, 1972 (the London Dumping Convention);
 (b) the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, and the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto, with Annexes I, II, III, and V (MARPOL 73/78);
 (c) the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers with Annex, 1978, (the STCW Convention);
 (d) the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, and the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (SOLAS);
 (e) the International Convention on Load Lines, 1966 (the Load Lines Convention); and
 (f) the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (COLREGS).

3. When such vessels are warships, naval auxiliaries or other state-owned or state-operated vessels used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service, they shall take appropriate measures not impairing operations or operational capabilities of such vessels, to ensure that they act in a manner consistent so far as is reasonable and practicable with these provisions.

4. If they are not parties, they become parties to the conventions listed in paragraph 2 (a) - (f).

5. Those that are parties to MARPOL 73/78 consider taking actions within the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to secure designation of the waters south of 60 degrees South Latitude as a special area under Annexes I and V of that Convention, provided that the establishment of reception facilities otherwise called for in these Annexes not be considered either necessary or desirable in the Antarctic Treaty area.

6. They establish contingency plans for marine pollution response in Antarctica, including contingency plans for vessels operating in the Antarctic Treaty area, particularly vessels carrying oil.  To this end they shall:
 (a) cooperate in the formulation and implementation of such plans and in responding to pollution emergencies in Antarctica; and
 (b) draw on the advice of the IMO and other international organizations, as appropriate.

7. They convene, in accordance with Recommendation IV-24, a meeting of experts to consider and provide advice on the establishment of contingency plans for marine pollution response and additional requirements to reduce and prevent pollution of the Antarctic marine environment, giving due consideration to the need to avoid detrimental effects on dependent and associated ecosystems outside the Antarctic Treaty area.

8. They keep under continuing review measures to reduce and prevent pollution of the Antarctic marine environment.
