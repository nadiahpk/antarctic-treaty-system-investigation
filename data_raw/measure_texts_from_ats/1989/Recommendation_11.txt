Recommendation XV-11 (ATCM XV - Paris, 1989)

ANTARCTIC PROTECTED AREA SYSTEM:
ESTABLISHMENT OF MULTIPLE-USE PLANNING AREAS (MPAs)

The Representatives,

Desiring to protect and maintain the unique biological, geological, glaciological, geomorphological, ecological, scientific, historic, aesthetic, scenic and wilderness values of Antarctica;

Recalling Recommendation XIII-5 inviting the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) to offer advice on the system of protected areas in the Antarctic;

Noting that SCARâ€™s response to Recommendation XIII-5, provided in its report "The Protected Area System in the Antarctic", recommended among other things that the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties create an additional category of protected area where coordinated management of activities would minimize harmful environmental impacts so as not to detract from the values for which the area was designated;

Recalling the importance of preserving the freedom of scientific research guaranteed by the Antarctic Treaty;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1.  They take cooperative action to ensure that ongoing and planned human activities in Antarctica, through their combined or cumulative effects, do not result in mutual interference or in adverse impacts upon the Antarctic environment.

2.  As one means to this end, they designate, where appropriate, Multiple-Use Planning Areas (MPAs) to assist in coordinating human activities in those areas where such activities pose identified risks of mutual interference or cumulative environmental impacts.

3.  The number and size of MPAs be kept to the minimum necessary to meet the objectives set forth in paragraphs 1 and 2.

4.  Each Multiple-use Planning Area shall be designated pursuant to a management plan developed through consultations, as appropriate, among interested Parties and approved by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties.  Such plan shall, as appropriate, include:
 (a) a description of the purposes and objectives of the management plan;
 (b) a description of the area to which its provisions apply;
 (c) a description of ongoing and planned human activities, including the operation of research stations and related logistics activities;
 (d) identification of any Specially Protected Areas (SPAs), Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), Specially Reserved Areas (SRAs), and Historic Monuments (HMs) within the MPA;
 (e) a description of the environmental characteristics and features and subjects of current and planned scientific research, if any, threatened by interference by ongoing or planned human activities or their cumulative impacts;
 (f) specific measures to avoid or minimize mutual interference and cumulative impacts, including where necessary measures applicable to:
     (i) construction and operation of stations and related logistic support facilities;
     (ii) vessel operations, including identification of areas which are unsafe for navigation, designation of safe anchorages and sea lanes or channels for safe access to stations;
     (iii) small boat operations, including maintenance and discharge control, and identification of areas where operations should be prohibited (except for essential research);
     (iv) aircraft and helicopter operations, including designation of safe landing areas, and identification of areas where operations below a designated altitude should be prohibited;
     (v) vehicle operations, including maintenance and discharge controls and identification of areas which are unsafe or unsuitable for operation;
     (vi) scientific research activities, including means to ensure the availability of up-to-date information about the nature and location of ongoing or planned field work, and means to prevent disturbance of organisms or features being studied by various investigators;
     (vii) visitors, including designation of areas within which access by tourists or other visitors should be limited or prohibited, and/or as areas to which such access might be directed to obtain maximum benefit from exposure to the characteristics of the area;
     (viii) information, including means to ensure that all individuals present or intending to be present within the MPA, are fully aware of the provisions of the management plan, as well as other relevant measures adopted by Consultative Parties (e.g. provisions governing access to scientific stations);
      (ix) notification, as far in advance as possible, by each Party of research and other activities which it or its nationals intend to carry out in the MPA, including copies of any necessary permits issued;
      (x) annual reports by each Party of activities it or its nationals carried out in the MPA management plan and any instances of possible violations of the management plan;
 (g) provisions for periodically reviewing the plan to identify changes that may be necessary to take account of changing circumstances or better to accomplish their purposes.

5.  They invite SCAR, through their national committees, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, and, as appropriate, other components of the Antarctic Treaty system to review and comment on proposed management plans for Multiple-Use Planning Areas before designation is considered by the Consultative Parties.

6.  They periodically review management plans to ensure that they are being implemented effectively and, as appropriate, approve proposed changes necessary to take account of changing circumstances or better to accomplish their purposes.
