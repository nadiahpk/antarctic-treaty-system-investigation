Recommendation XV-21 (ATCM XV - Paris, 1989)

USE OF ANTARCTIC ICE

The Representatives,

Considering that the ice existing in Antarctica represents the world's largest freshwater reserve;

Noting that, technological developments might one day make it possible to utilize icebergs detached from the continent for freshwater requirements, especially in coastal areas;

Recalling the principles enshrined in the Antarctic Treaty, which lay down a regime for international co-operation guaranteeing that Antarctica shall continue for ever to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and shall not become the scene or object of international discord;

Convinced that the structure established under the Antarctic Treaty has proved effective in promoting international peace, in keeping with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter;

Concerned that uncontrolled activities relating to the exploitation of Antarctic icebergs could also have an adverse effect on the unique Antarctic environment and its dependent and associated ecosystems;

Noting that sufficient scientific information is not yet available on the environment impacts, including global climate and weather, which might occur in the event of floating icebergs being used for that purpose;

Noting that the harvesting of ice in the coastal regions of Antarctica, especially if this were to require land-based installations, could give rise to a number of additional environmental or other issues;

Acknowledging that the Antarctic Treaty is the most appropriate framework for fostering international efforts to guarantee the protection of the environment and give impetus to the freedom of scientific research and co-operation in Antarctica;

Recognizing the desirability that commercial exploitation of Antarctic ice not occur, in any case, prior to examination by the Contracting Parties to the Antarctic Treaty of the issues posed by such activity;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1.  They exchange information on the feasibility of commercial exploitation of icebergs, relevant technologies and possible environmental impacts.
2.  Through their national committees, they invite SCAR to provide advice, as appropriate, on the above-mentioned matters, and continue to co-ordinate research programmes in polar glaciology, biology, oceanography, and meteorology in relation to Antarctic ice.
3.  They include an item on "Use of Antarctic Ice" on the agenda of the XVIth Consultative Meeting.
