Recommendation XV-17 (ATCM XV - Paris, 1989)

FACILITATION OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH:
THE SITING OF STATIONS

The Representatives,

Reaffirming that freedom of scientific investigation as set out in Article II of the Antarctic Treaty is one of the fundamental principles of the Treaty;

Affirming that measures adopted in this Recommendation are not intended to interfere with the possibility of a non-Consultative Party establishing a station in Antarctica but to ensure that such Parties may maximize their contribution to knowledge and the protection of the Antarctic;

Recalling Recommendations I-I, VI-4, VII-1, VIII-11, VIII-13, IX-5, XII-3, and XIV-2;

Recalling that at the XIIIth Consultative Meeting, Recommendation XIII-6 was adopted, calling for consultations between nations with Antarctic programmes operating existing stations in the same vicinity;

Recalling that the Final Report of the XIVth Consultative Meeting notes that:

(a) new stations had a greater possibility of maximizing their scientific potential if established in the widest possible range of areas;
(b) SCAR had:
    (i) recorded its concern that the continued increase in the number of stations in some parts of the Antarctic could result in unproductive duplication of scientific programmes; and
    (ii) recommended that adequate prior notice be given of intent to undertake a development or scientific activity that is likely to have a major environmental impact; and
 (c) a process of consultation was needed which started as early as possible in the planning stage of the new station and continued through subsequent stages, including the development and implementation of routine operations;

Recognizing that the establishment of a new station or major logistic support facility is an activity which is likely to have more than a minor or transitory effect on the environment and is therefore subject to the Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation procedure described in Recommendation XIV-2;

Bearing in mind that while the establishment in the same vicinity of scientific research stations and logistic support facilities may favour scientific co-operation and the functioning of these stations, excessive concentration of such installations may have a negative effect on scientific activities and on the environment;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1.  They urge Contracting Parties, when considering the establishment of new stations or facilities, to take the following measures to avoid excessive concentration in Antarctica of such stations or facilities:
 (a)  as early as possible when considering the establishment of a new station or facility in the vicinity of one or more existing stations or facilities, Contracting Parties should initiate, through their national Antarctic programmes, a process of consultations, co-ordination and possible cooperation with the other national Antarctic programme or programmes concerned;
 (b)  they should continue this process through the subsequent stages, including the development and implementation of routine logistic operations, with a view to minimizing both interference with existing programmes and impact on the environment;
 (c)  before establishing a new station or facility, Contracting Parties should prepare a Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation in accordance with Recommendation XIV-2.
2.  In the case of a station or facility which the national Antarctic programme of a non-Consultative Party proposes to establish, they offer assistance to the managers of that programme with respect to the choice of site and the preparation of the Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation, with a view to maximizing the scientific output of the new programme and minimizing its environmental impact.
