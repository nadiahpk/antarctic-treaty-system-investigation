Recommendation XV-10 (ATCM XV - Paris, 1989)

THE ANTARCTIC PROTECTED AREA SYSTEM: 
ESTABLISHMENT OF SPECIALLY RESERVED AREAS (SRAs)

The Representatives,

Recognizing that the increasing number and scope of activities in the Antarctic Treaty area may reduce the unique scientific and other values of Antarctica;

Noting that the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora established a mechanism to designate Specially Protected Areas to preserve the unique natural ecological systems of areas of outstanding scientific interest;

Noting also that neither the Agreed Measures nor other Recommendations adopted by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties provide a specified mechanism for identifying and protecting areas of outstanding geological, glaciological, geomorphological, aesthetic, scenic, or wilderness value;

Recalling that Recommendation VII-2 calls upon the Antarctic Treaty Parties to include in the series of Specially Protected Areas listed in Annex B of the Agreed Measures:

 (a) representative examples of the major Antarctic land and fresh water ecological systems;
 (b) areas with unique complexes of species;
 (c) areas which are the type locality or only known habitat of any plant or invertebrate species;
 (d) areas which contain specially interesting breeding-colonies of birds or mammals; and
 (e) areas which should be kept inviolate so that in the future they may be used for purposes of comparison with localities that have been disturbed by man;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1.  They undertake a continuing review of the geographical features and uses of Antarctica and, as appropriate propose designating areas of outstanding geological, glaciological, geomorphological, aesthetic, scenic, or wilderness value as Specially Reserved Areas (SRAs).

2.  Proposals for designation of Specially Reserved Areas shall be accompanied by a proposed management plan which shall include:
 (a) a clear description of the location and the key features of the proposed SRA, including a description of the markers and/or natural features that delineate the area;
 (b) a map and/or photographs showing the boundaries and key features  of the proposed SRA;
 (c) the rationale for the proposed listing;
 (d) descriptions of the types of activities that could be conducted in or near the proposed SRA without jeopardizing the special values intended to be protected;
 (e) descriptions of the types of activities (including activities outside the SRA) that could adversely affect the special values intended to be protected; and
 (f) descriptions of steps that should be taken to minimize impacts in cases where access to the SRA is authorized;

3.  In due course, they include in the series of Specially Reserved Areas representative examples of the major geological, glaciological, and geomorphological, features of Antarctica, and representative examples of areas of outstanding aesthetic, scenic, and wilderness value.

4.  Entry into Specially Reserved Areas be prohibited, except for the purposes authorized in the approved management plan for the area or in accordance with a permit issued by the appropriate national authority for a compelling scientific purpose which cannot be served elsewhere, and which will not adversely affect the natural features intended to be protected by the SRA.

5.  They invite SCAR, through their national committees, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, and, as appropriate, other components of the Antarctic Treaty system to review and comment on proposals before they are considered by the Consultative Parties.

6.  They annually advise SCAR and each other of activities that they authorized to be conducted in Specially Reserved Areas during the preceding year, and that they expect to authorize in the following year.
