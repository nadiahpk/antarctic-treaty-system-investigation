Recommendation XV-9 (ATCM XV - Paris, 1989)

ANTARCTIC PROTECTED AREA SYSTEM:
DEVELOPMENT OF IMPROVED DESCRIPTIONS AND MANAGEMENT PLANS FOR SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS

The Representatives,

Recalling that:
 (a) the purpose of Specially Protected Areas is to preserve both unique and representative examples of the natural ecological systems of areas which are of outstanding scientific interest; and 
 (b) the appropriate national authority of Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties may issue permits authorizing its nationals to enter Specially Protected Areas for compelling scientific purposes which cannot be served elsewhere;

Noting that the descriptions of Specially Protected Areas in Annex B of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora do not provide detailed descriptions of the natural ecological systems and components thereof that the Protected Areas are intended to preserve;

Noting also that the descriptions of Specially Protected Areas do not indicate the types of activities that could or could not be carried out in the designated Specially Protected Areas without harming or damaging any of the components of the natural ecological systems that the areas are intended to preserve;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1.  They review the descriptions of Specially Protected Areas in Annex B of the Agreed Measures and, for those Areas which they or their nationals had proposed be listed in the Annex, they provide a more detailed description of the natural ecological system that the Area is intended to preserve and a provisional Area management plan for consideration at the XVIth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting;

2.  Future proposals for designating Specially Protected Areas include:
  (a) a clear description of the location and the key physical and biological features of the area to be protected, including a description of the markers and/or natural features that delineate the area;
  (b) a map and/or photographs showing the boundaries and key  features of the proposed Specially Protected Area;
  (c) a detailed description of the key components of the unique natural ecological system intended to be preserved by designating the area as a Specially Protected Area;
  (d) descriptions of the types of activities (including activities outside the Area) that could jeopardize any of the components of the  unique ecological system intended to be preserved; and
  (e) descriptions of steps that should be taken to avoid or minimize damage in cases where access to the area may be authorized for a compelling scientific purpose which cannot be served elsewhere;
  (f) descriptions of measures necessary to ensure preservation of the area's unique or representative natural ecological systems.

3.  They invite SCAR, through their national committees, to have regard to the preceding when considering proposals for Specially Protected Areas; and

4.  They annually advise SCAR and the Antarctic Treaty Parties of any activities that they authorized to be conducted in Specially Protected Areas during the preceding year and that they expect to authorize in the next year.
