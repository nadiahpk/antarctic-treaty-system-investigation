Recommendation VII-2 (ATCM VII - Wellington, 1972)

REVIEW OF SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS

The Representatives, 

Recalling: 

 (1) that the purpose of Specially Protected Areas is to preserve, in accordance with the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora, the natural ecological systems of areas of outstanding scientific interest; 

 (2) that Recommendation VI-8 has notably increased the protection afforded to Specially Protected Areas by prohibiting entry into them except in accordance with a permit; 

Recognising that the existing Specially Protected Areas were designated under less strict provisions regarding entry; 

Conscious of the need to review the existing Specially Protected Areas in the light of experience and the increased degree of protection they have been afforded; 

Recalling Recommendation III-X which encouraged SCAR to continue its interest in and prepare reports from time to time on the conservation of Antarctic fauna and flora; 

Noting the opinion of SCAR, expressed in the report produced at its Twelfth Meeting on the ''Purposes and Designation of Special Areas'', that the existing Specially Protected Areas are not fully representative of the major Antarctic land and freshwater ecological systems and that some of these ecological systems are over-represented in the series so far designated; 

Recommend to their Governments that: 

1.  In due course they include in the series of Specially Protected Areas listed in Annex B of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora: 

    (a) representative examples of the major Antarctic land and freshwater ecological systems; 
    (b) areas with unique complexes of species; 
    (c) areas which are the type locality or only known habitat of any plant or invertebrate species; 
    (d) areas which contain specially interesting breeding colonies of birds or mammals; 
    (e) areas which should be kept inviolate so that in the future they may be used for purposes of comparison with localities that have been disturbed by man; 

2. They invite SCAR, through their National Committees, to review in the light of the criteria set out in paragraph 1 the existing Specially Protected Areas, and to make recommendations about: 

    (a) the desirability of retaining each Area; 
    (b) the desirability of redefining the limits of each Area retained; 
    (c) creating such additional Areas as may be considered desirable; 

3. The number of Specially Protected Areas should be kept to the minimum that will meet the criteria set out in paragraph 1; 

4. The size of each Specially Protected Area should be the minimum required to serve the purpose for which the Area has been designated.
