Recommendation VII-6 (ATCM VII - Wellington, 1972)

ANTARCTIC RESOURCES - EFFECTS OF MINERAL EXPLORATION

The Representatives, 

Recalling the provisions and principles of the Antarctic Treaty; 

Reaffirming that it is in the interest of all mankind that the Antarctic Treaty Area shall continue forever to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and shall not become the scene or object of international discord; 

Acknowledging that the Antarctic Treaty places a special responsibility upon the Contracting Parties to exert appropriate efforts, consistent with the Charter of the United Nations, to the end that no one engages in any activity in the Antarctic Treaty Area contrary to the principles or purposes of the Treaty; 

Noting the technological developments in polar mineral exploration and the increasing interest in the possibility of there being exploitable minerals in the Antarctic Treaty Area; 

Noting that there is a need for further study and deliberation amongst the Consultative Parties; 

Recognising that mineral exploration is likely to raise problems of an environmental nature and that the Consultative Parties should assume responsibility for the protection of the environment and the wise use of resources; 

Conscious of the special situation in the Antarctic arising from the particular regime of the Antarctic Treaty and the Recommendations adopted under it;

Recommend to their Governments that the subject "Antarctic Resources - Effects of Mineral Exploration" be carefully studied and included on the Agenda of the Eighth Consultative Meeting.
