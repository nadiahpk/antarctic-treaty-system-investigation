Recommendation VII-3 (ATCM VII - Wellington, 1972)

SITES OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST

The Representatives, 

Recognising that: 

(1) scientific investigations may be jeopardised by accidental or wilful interference; 

(2) sites where such investigations are proceeding may require a measure of protection; 

(3) because of the continuing scientific investigations in them, certain localities of botanical or zoological interest are not suitable for designation as Specially Protected Areas under the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora; 

(4) sites of non-biological interest cannot be designated as Specially Protected Areas; 
  Considering that the application of individual management plans regulating access and use for a specified period to such sites, which might be called Sites of Special Scientific Interest, would enable investigations at these sites to be carried out without interference; 

Recommend to their Governments that: 

1.  They invite SCAR, through their National Committees, to consider this matter further and make suggestions for the designation of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (together with a proposed management plan for each site); 

2.  They study the subject further with a view to its inclusion on the Agenda of the Eighth Consultative Meeting.
