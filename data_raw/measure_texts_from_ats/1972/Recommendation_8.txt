Recommendation VII-8 (ATCM VII - Wellington, 1972)

CO-OPERATION IN TRANSPORT

The Representatives, 

Recognising that the relative inaccessibility of many regions of the Antarctic Treaty Area creates special transport problems; 

Acknowledging the benefits to be derived from international co-operation in scientific investigations in that Area; 

Recommend to their Governments that: 

1. They accept the principle of using, where appropriate, common transport facilities by sea and by air for scientific and other personnel proceeding with their equipment to and from Antarctic stations; 

2. They encourage bilateral or multilateral consultations between Contracting Parties in order to establish when arrangements for such common use of transport facilities would be mutually convenient and practicable; 

3. The cost of the use of any common transport facilities should be arranged by agreement between the Contracting Parties concerned, either by direct payment, by reciprocation in kind, or by other mutually agreed means.
