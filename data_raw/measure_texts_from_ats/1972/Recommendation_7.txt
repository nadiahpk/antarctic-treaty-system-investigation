Recommendation VII-7 (ATCM VII - Wellington, 1972)

ANTARCTIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS

The Representatives, 

Considering the contribution to the study of Antarctic radio propagation and the ionosphere made at the SCAR Symposium on "Scientific and Technical Problems Affecting Antarctic Telecommunications" held in Sandefjord, Norway, in May 1972, and the Interim Report of the SCAR Group of Specialists (Revised 25 August 1972); 

Recognising the need for improving, as far as practicable, the transmission of information between stations within the Antarctic Treaty Area and between those stations and the rest of the world; 

Bearing in mind that difficulties may arise in Antarctic communications if new methods of transmission are accepted by Consultative Parties without due regard to the principle of compatibility both between new systems and between new and existing systems; 

Recommend to their Governments that: 

1.  Their offices administering Antarctic programmes take into account the information presented at the SCAR Symposium when considering new means of improving Antarctic communications; techniques discussed at the Symposium and brought to the attention of Representatives by SCAR and others including communication satellites, VHF low power scatter systems, oblique ionospheric sounding, coding and error correcting devices and the wider use of ionospheric prediction services, especially with regard to short-term advice on impending disturbances; 

2.  Their offices administering Antarctic programmes be encouraged to exchange information about changes contemplated in types of equipment or methods in order to improve, where practicable, compatibility between Antarctic networks.
