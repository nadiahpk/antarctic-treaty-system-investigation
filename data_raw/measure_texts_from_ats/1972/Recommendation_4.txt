Recommendation VII-4 (ATCM VII - Wellington, 1972)

EFFECTS OF TOURISTS AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL EXPEDITIONS IN THE ANTARCTIC TREATY AREA

The Representatives, 

Noting the increase in the Antarctic Treaty Area in the number of visitors who are not sponsored by Consultative Parties.
  
Considering that both Governments and such visitors would benefit from having available to them an agreed statement: 

    (a) of accepted practices in the Treaty Area including, inter alia, the need for self sufficiency and prior notification of intended arrival at a station, which such visitors would be expected to follow (to which could be appended the particular conditions imposed by each government for a visit to any one of its stations); and 

    (b) of the relevant provisions of the Antarctic Treaty and of the Recommendations made under it; 

Recalling Recommendations VI-7 and VI-11 concerning the possible harmful effects of such visitors on scientific programmes and on the Antarctic environment;  

Convinced of the need to avoid unnecessary interference with natural ecological systems which are not sufficiently understood and continue to be the subject of research; 

Conscious that the Treaty Area contains many unique features of historical, scenic and general scientific interest; 

Recommend to their Governments that: 

1.  They keep under review, in the light of existing Recommendations, the effects in the Treaty Area of tourists and other visitors who are not sponsored by Consultative Parties; 

2.  They consider drawing up at the Eighth Consultative Meeting a statement of those accepted practices and relevant provisions about which all visitors to the Treaty Area should be aware; 

3.  They consult each other well in advance about the possibility of designating at the Eighth Consultative Meeting an adequate number of areas of interest to which tourists could be encouraged to go, and about the criteria to be used to determine such areas; 

4.  They use their best efforts to ensure that the provisions of the Treaty and subsequent recommendations relating to the conservation of fauna and flora are applied in practice to all visitors who are not sponsored by Consultative Parties, as well as to tourists.
