# OCR

- situations:
    - Up to ATCM 19 (1995) inclusive, the pdfs have no layer of text, need LLM OCR 
    - From ATCM 20-22 (1996-1998) inclusive, the pdfs have a layer of text, and it's passable but not perfect quality
    - From ATCM 23 (1997) onwards inclusive, the pdfs have a high-quality layer of text under them, and OCR should be fairly straightforward.
- For the final reports, ATCM27_fr001_e.pdf doesn't have embedded text, and ATCM28_fr001_e.pdf does
- could use spelling mistakes per word to compare how text quality degenerates back in time


# Quirks and other observations

## Repeated names

List of docs 1975 notes that nbr 47 does not appear to have been used, but it appears repeated in the ATS database, check

## Summary

- Meetings up to and incl. 5 (1963) don't have standard-looking minutes.
    - Probably going to have to do these by hand
- After about Meeting 7 (1972), the minutes are detailed enough to start to see connections
- Will need to do a tracking of how Agenda changes from before to after Meeting
- Some early meetings have Agenda -> Rec but for previous meetings' Recs. Understand.
- Need to do a few case studies of how to track through years

## Details up to Meeting 10

- Meeting 1 has the full text of recommendations inserted into the minutes.
    - Minutes restart at page 12.
    - It's not organised by Agenda Item.
- Meeting 2 (1962) has basically no minutes of the discussion.
    - The only useful thing might be the Agenda and Working Groups.
- Meeting 3 (1964) also don't have useful minutes, though the WPs seem to tell a story.
    - Let's look at ATCM 1, Protection of fauna and flora.  There's redrafting of Art IV mentioned, and X and XI.  Those Arts appear under III-VIII.  It could be that the WPs under this AI might tell the story...
- Meeting 4 (1966) has nothing by way of minutes, basically.
    - I wonder if some of it is missing. Check ATAAD
    - BUT very usefully it has a list of Agenda -> Rec relationships for Recs from the previous meeting
- Meeting 5 has 9 paragraphs, the first 5 are procedural (e.g., opening statements), 6 lists the agenda, 8 and 9 are procedural.  
    - Paragraph 7 is the only paragraph dealing with the substantive agenda items, and it simply says that the meeting considered all Agenda items in plenary session, and appointed Working Groups for select Items.  
    - Then it lists the Recommendations and some Annexes.
- Meeting 6 (1970), sixteen paragraphs long, has a little more details about decision-making.
    - For example, par. 10 explains why Item 5 about the conservation of seals was considered outside their scope, and mentions the drafting of a new convention on seals that would be circulated as a WP
    - At the end, a list of Documents of the meeting
- Meeting 7 (1972) has 33 paragraphs divided by agenda item, and is usefully starting to look like minutes of deliberations.
    - We see par. 9 discussing seals killed and whether there's a risk of over-exploitation,
    - and par. 29 about a special conference about seals, which Chile wanted brought back into the ATS scope.
- Meeting 8 (1975) notes changes to the agenda; 
    - very usefully, the minutes paragraphs are split by agenda item.
        - (So we need to track the agenda items changes from before to after the meeting)
    - List of docs at the end.
Meeting 9 (1977),
    - has Agenda -> Rec relationships for Recs from the previous meeting. I need to study one of these.
- Meeting 10 (1979) has a pretty detailed minutes for each working group. 
    - It links the work to previous years' recommendations. For example, par. 13 says the Workign Group on oil considered Rec IX-6,
the Report of the Group of Eco and other experts (Annex 6), and some other materials.

# WPs info

- 1961, recall bad fit of Michael's model, find the WPs that were missing from Parsa and Michael's data included all WPs with coauthorships
