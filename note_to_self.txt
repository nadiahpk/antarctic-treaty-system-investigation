Up to ATCM 19 (1995) inclusive, the pdfs have no layer of text, need LLM OCR 
From ATCM 20-22 (1996-1998) inclusive, the pdfs have a layer of text, and it's passable but not perfect quality
From ATCM 23 (1997) onwards inclusive, the pdfs have a high-quality layer of text under them, and OCR should be fairly straightforward.

I believe the ATS website has labelled Working Group and Secretariat Papers in 1983 as submitted by Australia, and one of the UK ones is actually Australian.
Look for other instances of mislabelling.
