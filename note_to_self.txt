Up to ATCM 19 (1995) inclusive, the pdfs have no layer of text, need LLM OCR 
From ATCM 20-22 (1996-1998) inclusive, the pdfs have a layer of text, and it's passable but not perfect quality
From ATCM 23 (1997) onwards inclusive, the pdfs have a high-quality layer of text under them, and OCR should be fairly straightforward.

I believe the ATS website has labelled Working Group and Secretariat Papers in 1983 as submitted by Australia, and one of the UK ones is actually Australian.
Look for other instances of mislabelling.
... it appears that the host country is designated the author of the no-author papers, e.g., 1975, host is Norway, ATS attributes it to Norway
Not the case for ATAAD, though
Not a problem for my application, which only needs papers with more than 1 author, but make a note of it soemwhere

List of docs 1975 notes that nbr 47 does not appear to have been used, but it appears repeated in the ATS database, check
